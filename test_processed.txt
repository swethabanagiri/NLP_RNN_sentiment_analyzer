 worked (past tense) good (not perfect, good enough deserve a-)the buttons great. comfort good. sound good enough get workouts (i'm sound pro).at 6 month mark, device kept beeping holding volume key. yes, turned & on, reset etc. turned left alone hours. stopped little (about 20 min) started again. every time used after, would start beeping incessantly short unknown time interval.when read reviews item, take note long person owned device. p90x workouts, frequently sweat quite bit. wipe device finished. item never submerged, etc. device, books, sweat proof 6 months.judging reviews s10-hd, it's undesirable product. people owned s9 went s10 said worse almost ways. based experience motorola support device, want nothing products.support pretty bad. attempted online thought making headway.the rep chat ended telling they'd emailing directions mail (after attaching receipt chat).an email arrive requesting receipt again. replied gave receipt. response them.emailed another response receipt attached. response.did another online chat jumped hoops questioning again. end rep told call motorola, gave phone case number.called them. hold quite long time, talked agent (who put hold times) said they'd emailing directions sending in. that's is.it's taking hours resolve something could resolved 10-30 minutes.why can't resolve one agent, one session? 
 headset mic sound quality average however price it's bad deal. 
 i'd give 0 stars could - arrived dead - plug make lot scratching sounds, sound comes people can't hear (mic issue too).can't recommend.

 plugged work. bother trying figure shipment broken (i.e., stone back). i'm sure would great worked. 
 got thing saw heavily advertised solid protection phone's glass. used must say better one two dollar protectors. wrinkled, filled bubbles gets dirty easily. despite repeated efforts remove them, thing bubbles bubble bath. would recommend it, plus it's pricey! 
 don't waste money "lifetime replacement" get beeter protectors lot cheap prices. screen protectors usually last life phone anyway. 
 concept great tad heavy ears, would stay on. also, work w/ iphone-my ears almost blasted tried them. am, frankly, shocked s/e would make cool headset work w/ many phones, especially iphone. may work well devices...i cannot determine possibility.

 product claimed charger iphone 3gs. however compatible phone, work all! 
 price great delivery o.k. everything adequate. one small problem plug fraction wide fit 32gb 3gs. even squeeze insert pins, fit. cheap anything goes landfill. 
 case terrible!very flimsy, pretty, useless. glad paid next nothing one cases made unhappy. fan cases cover amount front phone. didn't cover much it, poor construction wouldn't allow case actually snap closed around phone. i'm sure broken shipping, production, time got end user product useless. 
 pretty phone caes however, paint started peeling within first two weeks owning it. basically get pay for. 
 purchased similar item. hoping would same. luck. wanted hold iphone car. strong enough. item purchased strong enough hold metal piece even case. one even strong enough hold phone own. returned soon got it. disappointed ordered wrong one!.

 t5 screwdriver work all. screw trying turn completely rounded, wasn't. bought much higher quality brand worked problem. screwdrivers complete junk don't waste money. plastic tool work okay, it's basically ruined one use. 
 product deficient quality, screwdrivers didn't last first screw heads got damaged, cheap product waste money well,dont buy it!!!!! 
 rather worthless, torx driver small fit anything &#34;most phone&#34;, tiny phillips driver that's totally useless &#34;most phone&#34; guitar pick (really!!) two plastic prybars might use, suction cup keyring attached.

 used one power sandisk sansa e280. failed within two days--less two hours use. sent back got another, failed within two days. piece junk. sansa doesn't even draw much power, old non-low-profile powered years. 
 bought pack travel bag use rental cars small is. must say nearly impossible remove. installed hertz rental, mazda 3 series think, nearly impossible get out. working car key angle turning, pulling, turning, pulling managed get 5 minutes work scraped knuckles. think probably great permanent install vehicle (though might care small then, course 2-port high power chargers almost small might want instead). travel bust. 
 recommend one buy product made china.now know cost $0.01, even though shipping cost $4.28.i used didn't even charge phone; instead drained phone's battery.worst all, device smells like burnt electrical wire. hot touch unplugged it.it quite possible left device plugged longer, would started fire.now, start looking another one, one won't burn one use.and, one actually charge phone battery.if shipping charges refundable, would return defective device. 
 purchased alernativewireles.com motorola droid 2 global. could barely get phone & out. wayyyy tight. second time extricated phone, stitches side ripped. poor quality fit droid 2 global stated description. 
 pretty cover seems decent quality price. like fact sort &#34;suede&#34; type feel outside won't drop easily. however, doesn't fit verizon iphone all- small. keep looking phone won't disappointed. toss one isn't worth bothering return it. 
 disappointed. item arrived one corners already broken (missing piece it, package). cover actually thick, it's slick seems picture. it's made cheap material makes iphone much larger without cover. fact believe falls down, cover click open protect phone all, what's point? look something else! 
 didn't like case sold fb try get money back sorry. 
 buy! wouldn't fit phone all. waste money since can't use it. 
 worked couple days, starting go out, noticed smell smoke. unplugged immediately threw trash. don't buy product, it's possible fire hazard. glad didnt plugged night asleep could caught fire! 
 don't think constructed actually charge 2 items once. 2 usb slots doesn't mean tolerate juice. gave soon purchase. 
 charger charge tablet something small, s4 galaxy tab 2 10". charge one other, chargers came devices...overall: small, older devices probably work you, otherwise pay money enough ampage. 
 thought great, didn't even use ports two days using...it didn't work anymore.seller: importer520 
 item failed first use. opened (i'm electrical engineer... open it, didn't i?) found decent circuit board, average components worst soldering job ever. failed? wires soldered back steel plug blades cold soldered came apart. plus blades held place friction fit also failed, leaving exposed metal socket plug came apart. construction bad estimate electrical integrity likely bad may actually harm delicate electronics like cell phones. careful avoid one!!!! 
 phone crashes constantly battery.when tried get replacement, seidio gave runaround refused issue rma. last two emails ignored. 
 cover battery came new listed, however inserted replacement battery tried put cover came it, immediately started problems. first all, battery cover wont properly latch phone time time actually come off. second thing noticed was, battery life palm pre plus ever slightly extended mean say, hardly noticeable.for extra bulk makes, self worth extra 30 minutes talk time gives. major problem problems listed that, replacement battery charges poorly say least. take forever charge use, use mobile hotspot feature palm pre plus, drains battery extremely fast. upon realizing this, started plugging phone home charger, however found even plugged in, battery still drains!i sense boxed big bulky worthless battery, bought car chargers switched back original battery cover. spend extra money better quality battery, wish had!!! 
 update: found method precentral determine actual battery capacity identified manufacturer. turns battery capacity 2300mah feeling ripped off. also another battery brand also showing mislabeled. complaining siedio posting back if/when make right.it still gives much better life standard battery, continue mislabel forced recommend brands available amazon anything siedio. explains barely getting twice life getting least 2.3x grrrr.i love pre+. one contacts calendar better palm. one ever has, one now, perhaps one ever will. but, pre uses battery centro battery life terrible. spent first day nothing internet appstore stuff, got 5 hours life stock battery. palm ashamed - get lot 5 hours notebook pc!so, 2.3 times capacity standard battery, get evening need recharge. don't use phone, able talk week one charge.this great choice want capacity. comes nicely finished back cover actually easier take put stock cover.two problems consider:1) doesn't work touchstone charger. didn't think would problem didn't even buy one. tried touchstone. coolest thing ever. sure wireless charging intelligent behavior changes touchstone nice. but, i'm impressed stick dashboard console equivalent car kit. much better slide around, look dial. i've ordered smaller seidio 1350mah battery fits standard cover 17% battery use touchstone i'm long drives. would give battery 5 stars option touchstone back plate. i'd willing pay $25-$30 it, too. hopefully technical reason can't make battery. don't care touchstone support, wont bother you.2) makes phone much thicker. problem me, actually makes easier type keyboard. but, goes "droid thin" 3/4" thick. that's thicker 1st-generation ipod 50% thicker blackberry curve. looking razor thin, need battery works stock cover. care long life, great.there batteries even bigger, twice price. hits right mix capacity size live thicker phone. two items don't bother you, great battery you, great price.oh, several mentioned problems loose fitting. apparently solved, fits well stock battery. ignore complaints. 
 dont usually get expensive accessories, decided splurge something nice new palm pre.unfortunately get pay for, tabs hold case onto phone broke month regular, well cared use, expensive case stay phone worthless. save money. 
 case many 5-star reviews. suspect reviews written soon user got case, put pre, impressed fit, finish, attractive minimalist design, matte finish, it's case still allows charge via touchstone. give one star b/c good case won't able use month?one main reasons bought case b/c high praise pre cen tral (seemed like everyone's standard case there) fact it's touchstone capable. sprint pre, know touchstone back included unlike verizon pre plus (edit 5/17/2010: pre plus avail at&t; include touchstone back charger! sprint continues fail selling original pre, pre plus, without accessories, yet it's still $150 many cities!). thought seidio's back replace palm's touchstone back received package discovered needed buy separate touchstone case (another $20). side note: accessories cost good change - $26 seidio case, $35 touchstone charger, another $20 touchstone back. spent $ 1 30 new pre radio shack 2 year contract. you're new pre, make sure use pre least month happy start plunking money expensive accessories.back topic: case way overpriced is. it's 2 pieces plastic (plus foam insert back cover you're using touchstone cover). depending buy, you'll spend anywhere $22-30+. plastic quite thin, however good thing b/c also feels quite strong, add significant bulk phone. that's one main differences compared $5 plastic cases ebay. plus it's feather light. fit perfect. thinness reason touchstone works. you're familiar touchstone, regular touchstone cover, magnetic field makes phone snap place quite firmly onto charger. putting thin piece plastic touchstone cover touchstone base. phone doesn't "snap" firmly onto charger less find sweetspot (you'll know feel it), charger, phone stays on. unfortunately, others mentioned, magnetic bond weak make stay place moving car.for wondering, case protrude gesture area impede gesture slider mechanism whatsoever. achieved? making tabs clip case onto phone small unobtrusive possible. major flaw. 4 tabs corner top cover bottom cover.i loved case. day 3, bottom-right tab snapped off. no, abuse phone case (it's new phone, remember?). regular use. understand, tabs small thin. give idea, tab width dental floss 3mm long. it's really matter time give break off. back cover 3 tabs became bit loose still usable. b/c pre legendary fit finish (ha!), loose back cover added slightly loose slider mechanism overall, phone felt cheap old. fast forward month today, bottom-left tab broke back cover pretty much useless. i've case little month.obviously, i'm one issue. find countless reviews tabs breaking. don't think unlucky ones. given time, case break. happen you. exception.so seidio addresses major design flaw, may better investing different case. touchstone important me, may want consider getting one zaggs clear films front - film advertised used "to protect helicopter blades" wrap around corners edges phone, flat top surface. back cover won't need protection b/c touchstone cover rubbery, scratchproof finish replaceable.i've read one reviewer saying seidio replaced case free contacting seidio soon see get free replacement well. even that, want keep repeating pattern ship broken case get new one?update 5/17/2010: actually contacted seller (authorized dealer) case replaced promptly free. ship them, cost two stamps envelope. time, got enjoy month, unfortunately, one tabs broke. i'm done case. i'll look getting clear film top using touchstone back.with everything said, cannot recommend case. save money look alternatives.update 7/20/2010: agf makes case that's touchstone compatible. google "agf grt pre case". said, enjoying case pre also means don't put bulk headache breaking. beginning thought needed case instinctively protect new investment. anything, enough use, amount care attachment dwindles time. screen protector film front touchstone back. bought screen protector film e bay (5 $3 shipped) it's zaggs cover entire front surface (does go curved corner areas), it's good enough me. zaggs overpriced anyway. 
 tabs break way easy! broke 2 within 2-3 weeks use! like little bulk added compared cases ended dropping phone 2-3x due stupid tabs breaking felt safer taking case off. would pick phone & case would pop would holding case & phone ground. also drop case case pop off! @ least body glove case didn't pop dropped (the whole reason buy case) drop phone lot!update 12/18/09got replacement, went ok within 2 weeks (possibly less) 1 tab broken & hill there, 2 days latter another broken & 3rd way out. took off. less stress & less likely drop without case. (i woudl find self holding case hand phone floor due case breaking)try body glove one don't care ts charger! little sturdy, handle drop 5. 
 speck case broke easily. rubber connects hard plastic separated every case owned. also, thin piece plastic bottom case breaks half use. would recommend product 
 wow, wish i'd read reviews actually purchasing product.design = horrible. people claim "protects" something beyond me. certainly doesn'tthe "skin" (that's is) isn't 'shell', it's piece plastic easily broken covers back phone.while didn't issue 3rd party connectors (ie: radio additions), see could problemwhile didn't huge problem vibrate switch, again, see problem future. hands huge, going nightmare eventually.the worst part? protection offered face all. protectors least wrap around front, offering minimal sort 'padding'. thing? nope, sits right around back, even touching front part phone. bad, front part phone one that's fragile!! 
 bought sim card put mother's law snaphone sending michigan, needed passcode establish account line, refill sim card, well silly thing, seemed like rocket science people, impossible .my husband spent hour th e phone, explaining robot, whole situation, mr. robot kept repeating lines, matter, said, kept repeating thing, nothing asking for. customer service, zero, need, happens robots repeat, luck, not.throw sim card trash.what else.i thought att good service back old mobile. 
 overall, worth getting, even 8 bucks.pros:the earbuds stay good sealgood sound calls audiobooks, acceptable musiccons:microphone goodthe control microphone nothing, media player, phone calls, anythingit huge microphone portion attached. essentially earbuds one piece, put another hunk wiring microphone. microphone nowhere near face figure clamp it's remotely near mouth.would buy again. doubts lg product despite label it. 
 it's bad used battery even though listed new one. crack one corner. charged whole day, put phone still juice. waste $5............. 
 battery wouldn't hold charge faulty beginning. disappointed would recommend anyone. total waste money! 
 tried two tours couldn't take anymore. got 8830 actually works. here's analogy...would rather mercedes (bberry tour) that's shop, toyota (8830) drive? list complaints comments tour:1) trackball didn't work correctly first one. tours, realized would accidentally hit trackball left thumb would go right side keyboard. (for typing word "you" problem.) "bump" would make cursor jump typing mess sentence. 8830 trackball farther away don't cursor jumping issue. thumbs stay side keyboard, it's likely problem you.2) sound horrible. remember old tv shows people disguised voices talking handkerchief? rim brought technology tour! everyone complained couldn't hear me...like muffled. (i test heard too.) handset! speakerphone worse quiet muffled. bluetooth unusuable. really i'd say tour great device, don't need use phone!3) battery life horrible. 2 hours talk time maybe 5 standby dead. used talk 8 hours previous bberry could go days standby. happened?4) gps worked great first one couldn't lock location 10 minutes second one. made realize didn't work second one correctly. unfortuately verizon disables gps 8830 didn't win point. love gps google maps tour.5) media player fine. crashed watching certain mp4 movies watched don't know cause.6) camera video camcording great actually...at least cell phone great.my advice get tour, make sure don't trackball problem, make sure give phone someone else call know pain others feel talking you. me, unbearable people say "what?" 5 times per conversation. own... 
 didnt' work two blackberry phones would sync either blackberry phones.------- ended getting visor mount motorolla works great. 
 horrible customer service - contacted directly dissatisfied product, he(she) resorted personal, verbal assaults instead dealing issues - wow - unbelievable. don't waste time - charge 50% restocking fee returns! review update: seller altec. would like stress comments directed towards seller, product - headphones fine, complaints there. 
 got belt clip otterbox defender case iphone 3gs. belt clip hold phone securely, belt clip extremely prone dropping phone.in six eight months i've otter case / belt clip, i've dropped phone due clumsiness once, phone hit deck lousy belt clip dropped maybe 99 times, including toilet! defender case amazingly effective, iphone lives unscathed, nary scratch, (oh irony) otterbox belt clip far single greatest threat iphone faces. belt clip warrants stars, zero, zip, nada, nil.the design belt clip simply failure. first all, unless everything absolutely perfect, defender case "snap in" belt clip. part (sides bottom) otter defender silicone cover perfectly fit onto case properly closed up, small bit clothing fabric gets mix, phone "lock" goes belt clip. since "feedback" whether it's "locked in" way find it's locked phone falls ground floor (or water). even snap in, it's strong hold, significant jolt bump movement halfway decent excuse worthless belt clip drop $5-6-7-800 worth iphone careening onto concrete. finally, clamp actually clips holder onto pants "locked open" setting. idea positive purpose design intended for, practice, tends lock open want open bending moving forth, again, whole thing likely drop waist (again) hit ground.i strongly recommend otter defender case, think people know belt clip comes works exact opposite direction protection. i've belt clip, it's junk. i'm throwing away going look one actually holds phone. 
 three clips break buy case; blet clips me.i abuse clips unless call normal wear teacher abuse. 
 waste money. followed instructions yet constantly air bubbles. i've repeated process without success. recommend. 
 exact charger came earpiece, one received amazon match one came samsung earpiece. color grayish ... cable material different ... cable length different ... micro usb plug different ... everything slightly ...so ... close copy genuine samsung product ... going risk using phone damage phone :(at least less $5 ... 
 ordered charger palm pre. lasted 5 months cable started tear end, connection goes cell phone. bit, wires sticking failed charge phone. piece junk - wouldn't buy again! buy name brand stuff. one got phone lasted longer rip one did! 
 would like hand advertising people. make sound like wireless charging device reality buy special case select devices ... buy way sold separately. situations don't offer special case wireless power cord adapter available purchase negates whole wireless idea, sold separately. many detail reviews saying thing isn't sleek sounds many hidden costs. must add adapter phone (which make bigger) order charge it.what would like mention alternative. check following link gomadic's universal charging station, charging station true charging station comes charger free tips charge many devices. see sell tips separately 3,000+ devices, charging station truly upgradable universal hidden gotchas.gomadic universal charging station apple iphone 3gs many mobile devices - uses gomadic tipexchange technology - 4 tips included 
 engineer, seems obvious product could function simply marketed. marketing completely misleading.standard devices like carry inductive charger built in, way powermat induce charging current device would delivered battery without sort wired connection.i surprised, sympathetic still surprised, many people would believe magic works simply marketed - "just toss iphone pad charges!" guess passengers maglev trains europe never charge devices.it gives perspective level understanding people electronic world live in. 
 four charging doors bought none work directed. yet able charge phone. 
 review changed due change product description.this originally advertised wireless charging product wired charging capability. controversy wireless aspect led device title name impossible knock deceptive. powermat.if type person go way cut cable clutter costs, including loss simultaneous usability charging, perhaps may work needs.cable/clutter phobic: personality aspect exist. although cables still provide fastest delivery data, charge functionality wireless alternatives date people go way avoid visible cable.wireless option, yes. easier usb plug, no. cutting clutter, don't consider mat wireless charging case clutter. personally, picking cable already sitting night stand, desk, console easy gets.as multifunctional charging base, make sure investigate fully comes box additional potential purchase requirements devices supported without optional accessories. 
 doesn't remotely anything says -- picture misleading, title misleading, concept misleading. purchase additional receivers attach phone, charge. basically sorta-cool looking way-too-big multi functioning charger wireless showerhead. read packaging still figure -- open up, course. 
 found hard see iphone navigation mode hard remove phone answer it. i'm longer using mount. car blue tooth latter less issue. phone won't go mount bumper it. 
 item that's pictured here! totally different item! returned soon opened packaging! amazon host third party items advertised correctly! 
 worst screen protectors ever purchased. always applying new ones every three months problems bubbles one two get out, terrible. went three trying get one without thousands bubbles underneath thicker usual protectors. buy again. went wal-mart bought them. paid money, bubbles. item appears seller described work supposed to. thanks thanks! :( 
 gotten part either house went p.o. post office said hasnt gone past forwarding please fix it! looooong time. already also 
 need talented get on. thin bubble easily. unless surgen,you tear first one.....that's come 3 pack. 
 waiting mophie release iphone 5 case got sick (5 months? seriously?) read surfacepad online, ordered it, love it! looks great, fits phone perfectly, really allows design i5 speak itself. could pleased!edit 6/22/2013: take thing phone, "seam" leather (which actually glued) started split come away cardboard (!) inside. twelvesouth supposedly warranty, contacted replacement. claimed record email address. verified email used sending copy invoice, never heard again. twelvesouth company want business with- make quality products stand behind them. avoid. 
 worst case ever. nice design whomever manufactured it, used lowest quality materials. less months use falling apart. looks like service 5 years. spend money elsewhere. find without original box cannot return refund, deal vendor best, get replacement. so, i'm stuck 
 leather construction design case certainly novel, however major design flaw.the iphone 5 noise canceling microphone back near camera lens. fold cover surfacepad back talk phone hold phone ear cover blocks microphone. result callers trouble hearing sound garbled choppy. first thought caused location. multiple calls various locations one could hear well. removing phone surfacepad calls locations problems callers could hear loud clear. conclusion problem surfacepad, case cover folds talk going cause problem.if use case using device things talking use wired bluetooth headset ok case, kinda defeats purpose phone ( talking ).it also kinda awkward feeling looks pretty strange holding ear front cover folded back.i ended buying 2 ( 1 red - 1 white ) hex solo wallet iphone 5 cool case holds id credit card cover block microphone. works marvelous.so want use phone like phone avoid surfacepad ! 
 cover floppy since doesnt bend side phone stand stand. plus get one piece grit scratch screen. 
 cover protects back. face phone completely exposed. what's use? 
 mean, 2009 expect even cheap bluetooth headphones ok. awful.my unit almost certainly defective seems wires crossed callers heard instead me.but even callers able hear (a luxury, know) shoddy build quality really awful design (they're huge) would warrant one-star review.while sound quality calls passable, unit doesn't appear utilize edr means awful mp3 sound quality.anyway, users commented, keep looking, get much better headsets price. 
 you're looking average, every day bluetooth stereo headset, might okay you, it's definitely you're music lover. sound quality pair received really pretty poor. don't even look quality bass sound - it's there.i found that, positioned exactly ears, sound coming headset, reason, seemed getting filtered far away. wasn't matter volume - sound quality tenqa pair got seems really substandard. bass sound seems strain these, causing annoying crackling sound accompanying music that's playing.having asked callers sound calls, i've told sound "hollow", i'm "in chamber", found sound end calls, well.as far headset's appearance goes, looks like it's average quality, quite lightweight - may consider good thing, like know products i'm buying decent weight them, seem strongly made. wouldn't say either conditions met headset.overall, place value headset quality appear be, wouldn't price higher ten note. don't stand headsets current price range. you're willing drop thirty bluetooth stereo headset, keep looking - aren't worth it, opinion. 
 recently switched iphone 4s - solid, square cut metal edges, bit chunky - iphone 5c, thin, smooth plastic model. it's actually comfortable hand 4s 5s, need little protection: maybe something little less slippery. first tried acimo shell holster, awful: foam case soft, hard remove phone holster. decided go minimal, got simple clear plastic snap-on case belkin.it's simple, basic, unobtrusive, fancy. it's almost exactly right, except one thing. it's *just* bit long. one two millimeters. result phone jiggles case. down, side side. lot. enough set-your-teeth-on-edge annoying.maybe it's me. perhaps i'm fussy. pull phone (in case) leather holster belt, press power button top, don't want phone shift case. does. every time.sigh.update: i've traveling hong kong last week, using iphone extensively mapping, twitter, checking conference schedules, forth. jiggling phone case driving crazy. originally gave two stars, tried living it. one star - that's generous! 
 pro's:bright blue colorsleek-doesn't add bulk 5ccon's:flimsy plasticdoesn't protect frontlooks cheapvery slippery could make lose grip drop phonesave $10.00 look something better 
 went opening package trash within 24 hours.. looking throw away case weekend trip case you. 
 looking purchase, shouldn't expected much. $7.00 shipped? stupid expect something high quality.1) case best part. it's hard plastic rubberized. belt-clip feature well, nice. protect phone scratches. said, it's black rubberized white plastic, first time drop scuff it, white spot. biggest deal.2) screen cover falls almost immediately. really low quality. even on, really made screen look fuzzy, fell off, felt remorse.3) worst part charger. nothing rapid charger. doesn't charge phone. again, hold it, realize light is, shouldn't expect great results. weight 1/10th much i-go car, charges 1/10th much charger should. plug phone 1 bar battery programs running, 1 bar battery hour later unplug it. use programs make call, phone lose battery even plugged in. 
 car charger fit curve 8530 neither face cover. buyer beware 
 lcd protector fit phone start. caused blister edges turn caused dust buildup eventually push protector away lcd protecting. plastic case comes devise made poor materials clips hold together broke putting together. basically paid money use items 1 day. worth money, shipping longer worked phone. 
 item broken received it, edge broken opened soft pack came in. 
 benefit see one limited number electrical outlets. need devices charged one outlet area measuring 9"x8"?as nice idea "wireless charging" may sound, it's not, honest probably much hassle plugging device outlet it's charger (usually supplied purchased)the mat looks nice, it's thin stylish, uses one electrical outlet course, would grace counter-top area keep keys phone charge them.while wondering for, also asked actually charges phones household anyway?you need attach "power clip" know, like would attach power cord usually use charge phone. hopefully one 3 included adapter tips actually work model phones mini usb port.i 3 month old lg shine, guess they're really obscure? (you guessed it) adapter doesn't work phone, displays "mp3 charge error" attached.the box boasts support nokia, motorola blackberry doubt works ok them, mine requires another "tip" - sold separately course.the box also says charge 4 devices once! wow! - one clip? checked sure enough buy additional clips, they're $35 piece!so sum up, little $200 charge four devices shiny silver pad wireless technology ??? stick original chargers cost mmmm, oh yeah free! gimme break. isn't waste money don't know is. 
 first excited duracel mygrid starter kit. wife impatient tangled cables running everywhere, thought would great set charging station counter one cable. opened package set up, realized isn't workable solution family.___________________what get:* good sized platform set four devices charging.* charger cable.* three types charger tips.* one adhesive clip (yes, one)___________________the problems:starting obvious: kit comes one adhesive clips required charge device. whole kit gets one charged phone. that's shame, since two charging tips included package.speaking package, packaging worse most. charging tips nearly impossible get package without damaging them. wouldn't tried hard i'd know could use one them.most importantly, charging solution designed leave tip fairly bulky adhesive clip attached phone times. means you'll much bulkier phone pocket, probably won't fit holster case anymore. tip clip also interfere buttons near charging port phone.you also trouble access charging port phone data transfer, likely, since two three included tips mini-usb. means you'll remove tip beneath clip connect data cable (and hope don't lose tip).i found setup impractical create nuisance charging cables. entire purpose product reduce number cables, solution worse problem. wife one hates charger cables, told get rid charging station asap.even could get nuisance bulk added phone, price seems way high get rid couple cables. remember you'll need purchase additional tips & clips charge one phone. 
 product, never heard charging mat/grid, first experience one. first question seeing item was: why? would someone need charge items together one place? three different cell phones charge different brands? concept neat, wonder many people would really see benefit type item? example, iphone (and stupid me, didn't realize item, box, didn't iphone clip) case, i'd spending $76 (!!!) get charging grid another $35 get iphone sleeve (which tell isn't yet). so, spend $110 charge iphone duracell mygrid, or, charge free cable came included iphone. &lt;sarcasm> tough choice &lt;/sarcasm>i don't see item for. families perhaps? can't imagine person owns one phone would ever use device. you'd family four lost charging cables find benefit using device. simply cost savings (cost increase, actually) you'll likely incur even cost phone isn't supported box (the mygrid supports blackberries, lgs nokias).so took thing work see anyone would use it. remember, mat supports lg, nokia blackberry box. however, one willing adhere anything phone and/or phone wouldn't fit adapters (we iphones, lot blackberry storms winmo devices). simply put, one interest using thing!i finally got boyfriend use item, though wasn't enthused something stuck back phone didn't adhere permanently. finally unpacked thing, noticed 1 clip included. nice. guess much another clip is? $35! charging four phones thing, you're looking total cost $181!we finally put device mygrid yes, charged. charged well. device sleek looking lightweight. that's positive thing say it. setup installation super easy.basically, device isn't convenient. it's expensive likely require purchase clips sleeves. that's one expensive way charge phone!pros:* attractive design* ease use* convenience, sort-ofcons:* cost! omg, cost! $76 wayyyy much money thing. even five cell phone brands supported box came five clips, $76 would still way much item.* box, get one clip. additional clips $35* iphones supposed supported, sale yet. and, again, another $35 want charge iphone.* i'm sticking anything phone, period. there's way i'm walking around something adhered back it, adding bulk. 
 duracell mygrid awesome idea went wrong somewhere r&d; labs packaging marketing departments. idea conductive mat charge multiple phones something cool could used many households. duracell's implementation idea utterly fails couple reasons, though.first, what's box underwhelming. get mat, ac plug, one swivel clip, 3 adapters. 3 adapters 2 mini-usb adapters (one right side up, upside down) 1 nokia adapter. clearly, mgrid development years released now. evident mini-usb plugs typically found phones 2008 older, nokia plug, useful world-wide, doesn't high penetration rate us. least, high rate among type early adopters would interested product. iphone adapter (until spring 2010?), palm adapters, unbelievably, micro-usb adapters (commonly found 2009 newer phones). you're still rockin' razr 2006, maybe you'll find what's box useful. purchase product, given me, actually bust old razr test it...second, conductive clip part adhesive back supposed stick back phone, one 3 included adapters jammed side bottom phone. yeah, adhesive, in--it's gonna forever. adding bulk phone. joke. top that, smartphone want sync computer 2008 mini-usb port, um, well, can't cuz adapter jammed plug. even slip adapter, clip back still going block many usb connector cables there. finally, you're using mini-usb phone 2008, you're probably going get new one 2010 (when 2yr contract expires), means somehow peel adhesive place new phone (assuming buy new adapter duracell's website future fits new phone). able position clip adapter razr without using adhesive, magnet surprisingly strong. pulling phone mat caused lot strain phone's usb port. repetitive usage like could easily damage port phone. addition, without adhesive, took way longer insert clip + adapter razr carefully pull mat finished simply plug/unplug regular ac charger, thereby eliminating advantages using mat.i mention grid indeed work charge razr time regular ac charger. duracell totally failed execution device. people make batteries! need duracell-made battery replacements small metal conductance nubs back. way pop new battery lay phone, without extra bulk, directly grid. palm pre phone touchstone accessory works incredibly well. also, duracell offer replacement batteries/adapters cameras, video game controllers, electronic devices. would 5-star, highly versatile product this. no, instead get 2 mini-usb plugs, nokia plug, one swivel clip. craptastic failure pile box!as techie gadget lover, want really like product. actual grid cool. unfortunately, word adequately describe adapters + clip idea "stupid." time writing this, grid goes $70-90. dropped price $50, included adapters video game controllers cameras, offered conductive replacement batteries website like mentioned above, thing would gadget-person's dream charging station. then, i'm sure people duracell pushed market. bad... 
 duracell powergrid trying desperately capitalize new cordless charging device playground, service item provides date borders embarrassing. basically, device's cordless charging capabilities based sort remote plug put wireless phone mp3 player lay pad. three chargers come device devices old would need travel back time least three years find device could put chargers in. forget ipod newer blackberry newer wireless device, period. want charge powergrid, guess do?you buy chargers.there way part device simplify life even make happy way, skip it. 
 product case creating poor solution problem doesn't really exist. really easy charge phone plugging charger came it. wait, instead want glue weird disc back phone, add special tips charge it? buy special sleeve adds bulk cost same? thanks. 
 got charging station thinking would save us octopus tangle wires desk alas found frustrating. idea behind station simple - one plug, multiple phones charged duracell mention phone want charge must special clip. clip supposed permanently attached phone, thus making difficult keep protective cover case.the kit easy use comes one clips (this kit comes 3 - one blackberry, one set motorola last use nokia). want charge second phone need additional clips, purchase separately, making set cost effective.while great idea paper certainly well executed. someone creates power charging grid one simply place phone attachments stick charging cord. 
 one poorest designed products seen. price way range. comes one bulky "thumb charger clip" (and three adapters may may fit phone) attaches cell phone tape(provided). adapters expensive, around $30. adapters fit phones models. wanted buy 4 adapters would cost $120. charging grid cost $70 4 adapters $130, total price charge 4 phones around $200.i motorola phone work with, tape "thumb clip" found bulky carry pocket. since switched samsung phone adapters fit samsung.i use product cluttering closet waiting discarded. product poorly designed priced high duracell would choose market it. product much trouble deal with...and rarely write one star review. buy product. look grids wait improvement design price go down.i bet amazon retailers flooded returns. shame duracell trying push good idea, poorly designed product! 
 duracell mygrid charging device product want like. imagine possibilities, come home toss phone, ipod device pad walk away. wires plug unplug, several chargers plugged wall outlet. wireless home power grid, truly wave future.in reality, though, truly product far ready prime time "wave future" powergrid would think is. accurately "extension cord" transfers power via contacts totally traditional way.it ships 3 tips fit infinitesimally small number phone models. unfortunately, blackberry cell phone. design power tips prevent used device exact model specified.there two glaring problems duracell considered abandoned whole concept power grid. one location charging receptacle varies phone phone. mine impossible fit connect included charging adapter.the problem charging adapter itself. fairly large disc glue back phone double-stick tape. whaaat? kidding me? make line little charging tip probably 90% likely glued phone's camera, flash rear speaker. that's plain dumb!not mention, cell phone bought small convenient possible, slip pocket purse nice leather carrying case ... more! fragile adapter sticking side bottom phone, plus clunky odd-shaped stick-on disc, phone longer fits easily pocket, purse case handled extreme care extra pieces don't break get lost. plus, many phones use mini-usb connector, connector may used headphones, car speaker accessories data access. remove power tip time. convenient simply plugging phone charging cord?you also get optional overpriced "powersleeve" miniscule devices rubber boot fits device awkward hump back bottom device. maybe slightly better concept glue-on disc far seen one model ipod one model blackberry.another major failing products travel lot probably take charging adapter you. certainly won't take power grid. means removing power tip time reassembling use grid home. would get old first time.i fail see slightest advantage entire product; it's like bad april fools joke. someday someone come way transfer electric power without wires; understand technology already exists. duracell someone else comes power grid doesn't need ill-conceived adapters i'll interested.as far "instruction manual" goes, almost non-existent. product like people never used before, severely lacking.sorry duracell, can't give one star "interesting idea". 
 see reason item. first must attach small device phone. leave phone, every time charge must attach it. charge using device. leave attached, sticks can't use protective case phone. also, comes devices phones fit phone. need spend money get connector phone.forget item. actually difficult charge phone. 
 excited get item thought would quick easy convenient wrong. charging tips fit phone motorola nokia. lg big motorola, duracell doesn't even make adapter far could find out. charging pad smaller thought, smaller mouse pad. another dumb design put clip stick back phone, like need bulk it. don't want adhere clip spend another 35 bucks rubber sleeve put phone, already one protection don't need another.the whole thing works magnets clip, tip charging mat metal looks like scratch fast. i've seen connectors iphone, xbox 360 controllers well wii ps3 parts another investment 40 bucks. unless blackberry, nokia motorola phone one mini usb style ports, don"t get this! duracell needs go back drawing board redesign charging tips included starter kits lg samsung iphone included!!!pros:*only works motorola nokia boxcons:*doesn't work lg phones (tips made it)*iphones need additional attachment costing 35 bucks*small charging mat size*other limited brand adapters cost 35-40 dollars*have adhere clip back phone 
 feel sad guilty ordering item causing environmental waste. let explain.the box contained one charging surface, one power clip, 3 tips. 2 tips mini-usb sockets another seemed intended nokia device. cell phones motorola, none tips suitable phones.charging suface: looks cool, complaints.power clip: thin, flat, tear drop shaped piece plastic. need one things every device want charge. supply one. supposed stick (built-in pre-glued surface exists) back device. place device holster, sleeve, enclosure, forget it. surface flat clip contacts touch charging suface facilitating charging device.tips: one end tip goes device end contacts power clip. tip projects device - causing problems inserting device holster.why totally useless me:1) doesn't work phones - tips don't match use holsters phones.2) things charge using device gps mp3 player. don't charge home even week.for purposes, following product works much better:leviton l02-49686-00w 6 outlet adapter grounded white 
 product meant mistaken inductive charging system 3 major problems:1. box says charges 4 devices-- well, two iphones would barely fit it... you'll charging 4 those. power supply comes 1a power supply, iphone needs less amp charge full speed... can't charge 2 iphones full speed.2. product requires customer use special case... make sure said case ill-fitting unattractive.3. case must removed sync, charge normal charger.if willing accept limitations, win ease plugging iphone get home... really hard do? 
 i, like many cellphone users, really excited product announced. induction charging wave future charging small portable devices... unfortunately duracell's mygrid stuck flood past; still using connectivity charge devices - albeit clunky, ugly, inconvenient way.for reason head unit would utilize tiny little dongle would contain components needed charge phone. but, i'm sure you've seen, dongle connects bulky round disc houses charging system. disc charging prongs mated base mat form circuit charging. rather look around cellphone charger look around bulky disc, really convenient. course could tape disc phone, increasing phone's girth weight rendering cellphone belt useless... that's really convenient it?frankly don't see situation anyone benefits device. poorly thought aging tech. avoid. 




 works nokia 5530. inexpensive, got 2, one car emergencies. original nokia chargers retail box. brand knock (yes, everything made china days - real mccoy)...... 
 wife three years still working. great phone! 
 love device - it's one allows plug headset. happy report works perfectly verizon xv6800 smartphone (also known htc 6800 mogul 6800 sprint). one reviewing tried device, wanted functionality took chance ordered anyway. works perfectly!

 travel charger iphone fits iphone 4 fine, charges fine, it's sturdy. see know problems item. 
 worried bad reviews, however said re-desighned took chance, first one received large crack it, packaged ended returning ordering again, next one came box good. pleased this, ordered one price style different brand two like one better.- thin slim style ad bulk it- brand same-the belt clip much stronger looking brand, say need super strong clip may you, stronger brand ordered-one feature one clip one side case stand one don't want holster part use stand want pushed don't to, brand built holster clip scince phone faces seems kinda useless me. strong is?? problem would carefull. also otter box, say like one much better don't need super strong thick bulky type case, like switch cases colors suit mood, need. kind use love take gym clip shirt pants whatever problam want use stand playing works good, make higher end looking one got, like prefer one, said need super strong case may protection purse car basic use case good. buy again. 
 may everyone, like it. case solid. screen well protected leaving ample openings on/off, volume, camera, speaker, pen, earphone, microusb port. heeding warning users beltclip breaks readily, intentionally broke :) put rest holder/phone cargo pants. real fast getting phone out, bluetooth ubiquitous days, there's less need speed. built-in stand little unstable 'portrait' position, works fine 'landscape' position. also works well dash (gps) holder: i.trek me-usdm universal dashboard mount, also amazon. 
 i've found far best method clipping phone belt, i've used others many expensive always come back one built kickstand ability easily quickly slide phone out.they're cheap yes i've never problems durability except long time use, much longer would expect cheap piece plastic last, ones kickstands like locking mechanism eventually wears whole thing easily replaceable.i times knocked phone holster bumping something tradeoff pay lock obstructing access device. 
 pay verizon store. verizon store can't get belt clip samsung galaxy note 2. 
 well build carrying case last while.it eye catcher design allows phone breath get heated like cases.the belt clip build well,very solid also turns 360 degree positioned direction.this exact fit note 2 worth time. 
 going purchase phone, knew would need holster use practically. previous phone, droid 3, also holster, liked much. never grew fond idea putting phone pocket.i bought holster 4/26/13 and, despite many negative reviews, pretty sure bought new improved design. i've holster little 2 months time writing it's holding well. kickstand strong, feel weak flimsy, placing gn2 inside case, snaps firmly. in, would need like plastic pry tool get again, placing gn2 holster, fits fine.so far, dis-colorization (i white edition match housing gn2), criss-cross pattern isn't fading away, belt clip strong sturdy. use belt clip everyday hints anything telling it's going break time soon. belt clip place, stays there.as stated throughout review, don't see abnormalities product. managed break myself, would buy replacement. 
 fit function great. kickstand big plus. form tight cut outs neat.

 fits like glove. adds bulk phone - gs4 stays slim light!the kickstand works, doesn't slide around, nice firm. clicks shut two tiny tabs plastic either end kickstand, guess time tabs break won't stay shut anymore. moment, tabs really tiny hopefully break anytime soon.the downsides find are:a. hard feel whether pressed power/volume button not, there's tactile feedback push. work though.b. screw(?) holds kickstand place back case bulges makes phone sit slightly lopsided put flat surface facing upward. issue me, didn't expect screw bulge way does.otherwise satisfied.

 let start saying, like many others reviewing fabulous product. bought case tide could find better higher quality one. already otterbox commuter, like several cases. one provides protection i'm work, others smaller don't add much bulk. plus, somewhat case-whore. 12 cases s3.i thought case would suitable temporary case could find another one. wrong. good case period!like said, prefer slim fitting cases detract over-all slimness device. also prefer soft gel feel types cases hard plastic others. find provides better shock absorbancy feels better overall.this highest quality case ever bought $1.75 ($4.25 shipped).service-i ordered sunday night, paid minimum shipping price. fully expected wouldn't show week least (the fourth july following thursday). got confirmation email amazon said estimated arrival date would 6th-9th. thus, pleasantly surprised find case waiting mailbox wednesday afternoon. took two days get here. nice.quality-as said before, impressed quality case price. soft gel feeling plastic, glossy finish sides top matte black grippy finish back. back nice set dash board doesn't try slide off. can't really see pictures it's noticable person (but bad way).needless say, case tight fit phone, everything lines perfectly. i've noticed sometimes kinds cases cutout charging port won't quite large enough usb cable won't plug way. that's trouble plastic molds sometimes. case here. perfect fit. ports perfectly cutout.as power volume buttons, instead covered thus harder press cutout well. also fit perfectly hard press all. camera speaker cutout perfect well.this case fits phone perfectly it's unbelievable. tight hard get snug. sometimes i'm peeling try take battery cover too, isn't bad thing opinion.conclusion-once case highest quality case ever bought low price. keeps phone slim also provides needed protection bought for. awesome, awesome case. plan checking products company.overall, less five dollars door find higher quality case shiny new galaxy s4.
