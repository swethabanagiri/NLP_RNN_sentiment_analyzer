 worked first week charge phone 20%. waste money. 
 worked great first couple weeks stopped completely.. basically small waste money. 
 works one side time. connect two cables, one side stop working also overheated burning fuses. purchased two it's problem. cheap bad quality. 
 bought 2 tried test first ... minutes charging, felt hot. pulled product smelled burnt. tried one thing. careful... one could fire hazard could potentially destroy electrical system 
 case reason peeling, isn't much left orginal skin, loved case pink favorite color wouldn't recommend specific one anyone. 
 charger lasted week ad stopped charging samsung galaxy s3. really need start making chargers better....i've thru several!!!! 
 junk!!!......this product must miss labeled. get samsung s2 phone charge oem charger. lights on, phone says charging nothing happens. sure got defective product upsetting sit car hours see phone recharge. need reliable charger, purchase product.if need car charger samsung s2, would recommend motorola vehicle power adapter. charges fast dependable. 
 plugged car worked first couple days. hasn't worked since. phone even recognize it's plugged in. 
 thing worked well actually functioned, today stopped working past 30 day return window 10 days give take.i'm guessing quality might great stopped working, knows.. waste money. 
 first, kind cheap-looking, try buy cheapest oem car charger could phone, that's forgiveable. springs side don't much force, though, constantly slipping 12v car port. cable sturdy, rubber near connector kind stiff, makes charging operating phone go bit hassle. it's held well since purchased though.update: stopped charging month. 
 received product timely manner delightful, however, gave gift embarrassed find defective item. reimbursed product would much rather product worked first time. 
 marking legit samsung product cord stop working 3 days. i'm upset inexpensive maybe spend little buy better product amazon. work worked well. 
 charger doesn't charge battery samsung galaxy s2 (i9100) properly.when connect s2, screen gets frozen cell behaves unusual (abnormal) way. 
 nutshell, oem charger. although samsung markings, doesn't seat well samsung phone. means it's either meant another market it's counterfeit. said, wouldn't buy again.~~~~~~~~~~august 17, 2013 - updatethe seller tried make amends sending three replacement chargers. using while, still garbage. charge phone fact, drains phone. must counterfeit product. samsung markings charge phone. buy product!!!! 
 2 weeks charger fell apart taking plug , strong charger would asked money wasn't even worth . 
 one came broken bottom pice snaps sides main backing inlay piece. came scuffed paint pieces click together. broken would like it. also wasn't three click pieces 
 never this, almost bought product based amazing sounding fake reviews provided shills powerbear. look positive reviews case, see none verified purchases yet every negative review, one course, verified purchase. means everyone actually bought used product thinks crap. furthermore, many reviewers posted twice product, per color. amazon allows beyond me, point. also, look profiles positive reviewers, see posted multiple positive reviews powerbear products many reviews carbon copies other. beware paid shills! 
 watch-out, positive reviews fake. even reviewed twice using name. sleazy way sell item. 
 raving friend amazon great phone cases cheap bought this. didn't even fit phone right. poorly made. 
 case fit phone; tad small. could get 3 corners case. wound buying two piece case cost $20 local store. dropped phone many times case beat s***, damage phone. good reason buy case, one.my co-worker delayed getting case could find one liked, broke display screen, making phone unusable. buy case, rubber thing. threw mine away within 5 minutes it's arrival 
 read first reviews didn't read wish cause thing work sprint galaxy s2. wish known that. 
 different size/design galaxy ii carried usa what's carried asia. i'm usa, ordered cover galaxy ii bought usa, cover didn't fit, speaker location different phone. copmared cover another galaxy ii sold asia found design different.so bought galaxy ii usa, don't buy cover outside usa 
 purchased 3 cables cheap got good reviews. don't know people getting cables work... 3 bought, 0 functioned properly palm pre! best get charge, though entire time charging computer complaining "unknown device" "could install drivers" even though works beautifully original cable. setting works "just charge"! 3 cables fails slightly differently makes believe different flaw! i've tried wife's palm pixi well used different computers failed well. look elsewhere attempting purchase cable palm device! 
 "this cable recommended device." get error message. plus really short. 
 poor manufacturing quality connector long properly fit phone. would buy this. 
 cable good, fit samsung galaxy s4. plug in, far enough hold securely. 
 got charge samsung galaxy s2 always came unplugged phone, whenever phone would moved falls even resting flat surface would eventually find way phone. buy another usb cord became frustrated 
 disappointed cheap doubt designed newer devices. also short. took long time ship. specifically purchased due ad saying samsung galaxy devices. work s4. require good charger one newer better. 
 damaged charger. recieved charger short it. wiggle cord phone charge. 
 pretty upset find one day stopped charging phone, right middle long trip. ffffffuuuuuuu... 
 pleased item got back quickly gift. however, cannot give 5 star rating product never worked. 
 phone charger works, charges phone. however, phone charging continually beeps battery low.it stop beeping charging battery reaches certain percentage.i think correct charger using phone have.now worried based reviewers battery may blow phone i'll replace too.i would recommend buying charger.the charger old blackberry works better. 
 wrong one.the male end fit iphone 4s . pulled would retract 
 bad charger work properly really bad shortage. hate it! 
 installation easy tool kit worked though plastic tools robust break tweak much. paper foil coming battery open package folding back place worked, it's phone issue. far phone charges fast life much better 2 year old battery replaced. far would recommend battery.update: 4 weeks installing battery would last 5 hours barely using iphone voice calls time extra heavy use internet anything. drained charged dead several times, made sure location services, blue tooth, apps closed... still drained. got money back bought one 1/2 price one works great! maybe got defective battery.... risk take buying 3rd party batteries. 
 seeing 2, 5 star reviews item fake users seem trash talking iphone battery sellers 5 staring pretty messed therefore appears seller type scammer. 
 battery would charge iphone. iphone shut 2 minutes powered up. throw away. 
 really poor quality tweezer bent like nothing screw drivers made cheap plastic adhesive removing tool cheap plastic get pay would recommend anyone trying perform phone surgery 
 received today doesn't charge. i'm sure used - found piece broken iphone glass contact side. 
 eargels fit earpiece fine, nice tight, far actually getting sizes comfortably fit, forget 
 got jawbone headset. many said work great. life cant figure get work short superglue even quiet hear guess work jabra designed jawbone. 
 first installed one new jawbone ii, fantastic. fit ear canal perfectly, negating need ear loop came it. unfotunately days started rejecting headset. ear pieces would stay jawbone, would longer stay firmly ear. tried washing drying thoroughly, helped hour so. sure fit problem is, turned work jawbone ii all. 
 advertised fit habra stone. not. don't know changed advertisement since aid package habra stone got it. even one piece fit. threw away 
 bought headset would comfortable...these hurt ears like one comes matter size use. wouldn't recommend anyone...don't waste money. 
 tried using sansa clip mp3 player toyota mr2. car makes lot noise case, i'm holding audio lab quality. however, product made quite audible (at low automobile speeds) click-click-click. might able tolerate that. however, also electronic whistle increasing frequency rpm engine. whistle interfered excessively intended sound player. volume coby ca-747 ok. hadn't thought would issue bought comparable maxell cassette adapter long's replace coby ca-747. volume maxell product weak, turn way up. maxell didn't go click-click-click, whistled, too. maxell coby get 1 star me. i'm trying offering philips next... 
 disspointed getting coby cassette tape work car :/ need music 
 keep short sweet -cord contains lead must handled regularly car nowhere clean hands touching thing.sound quality quickly goes downhill crackling evident 5 uses.now stuck dashboard player modular adapter broke cassette fully eject. sure husband griping entire time tries get unstuck.avoid costs!i scanned past negative reviews since product really positive reviews lot helpful votes. big mistake unstick adapter cassette player try get amazon take back. (i bought 2 clearance) 
 things confidence trick. don't thing. can't thing. believe make phone work better probably find stripes side cars make go faster too. 
 come amazon, can't really believe selling name! 
 thing waste paper, doesn't give u better reception. total rip book :-( 
 want try one? sell dollar stores. nothing improve signal. 
 didn't work, work all. dead spot drive work, totally lose signal. device help all. waste money it. even less $2.00, worth anything. 
 cant say works tryit long time iphone didnt made difference all... 
 contrary site t-mobile lead believe, t-mobile could provide coverage home address. stop amazon.com selling phone, t-mobile transferring existing (working) at&amp;t number service (of course, took two weeks &gt; 10 phone calls).after receiving reception, called t-mobile informed actually cover area.i called at&amp;t back, happily attempted restore account, find t-mobile refused release numbers.after month essentially coverage anyone, phones happily back at&amp;t belong.the bad news t-mobile sent bill double quoted monthly rate amazon.com refunded purchase price.even areas could get coverage, phone work well. pressing keys, screen would lock needed remove battery reset it.last warning: watch charges inbound messages--if really dislike t-mobile subscriber, send lots text messages (free site)--the subscriber pay $0.05/message. 
 doesn't fit phone must return it. hassle! that's say! 
 ordered based rave reviews saw it. using treo 600 barely hear anything ear piece, even spongy covering removed. 
 item useless. plug far small fit phone, despite description fit "lg phones". dare doesn't fit. dare uses standard jack thing 2.5 mm whatever. uses tiny plug? i've never seen size cell phone! get pay for. item joke. 
 importantly, point thing goes ear cheap, thin little foam pad wear quickly. mine arrived, little pieces inside plastic bag shipped in. box, packing - even cheap bubble wrap rubber band, chucked bag. realize it's super cheap last month. now? wish amazon would be... selective offer sale. 
 sound fine headset, however mic work all.waste money worth returning. 
 earpiece stamped "verizon" different finish pictured. packing slip enclosed usps envelope came showed, "accstop" oxnard, ca. $2.47, guess doesn't matter still, item pictured. also came little plastic baggie - represented new.cannot try 3.5mm adapter hasn't arrived item earpiece set purchase. 
 purchased 4 different jabra headsets, comfortable easy hear with, poor microphone quality. thought would try model, mx150 flexible boom. again, sound quality crap. make living phone, others able hear important.i ended getting ge tl26593 earset microphone jasco worked best far. 
 phone ugly heavy terrible user interface even techies like myself. also drops calls like crazy manhattan. moto v600 much better phone, takes better pictures, gives better clarity reception, smaller, much, much cheaper. get moto v600 want t-mobile. stay away ugly monster. 
 recently moved phoenix, arizona, thought good time get new mobile phone. friend recommended nextel, saying we'd use direct connect function. cool. ordered i730 amazon. charging activating waiting required day, called get phone number. palo alto, ca, number!? that's 700 miles away! 11 hour drive next state. way close local number. nextel seem understand care. &quot;it's closest have.&quot; &quot;there 602 area code phone numbers left.&quot; begged maybe 480 number anything local call phoenix. nothing doing. days calls nextel went nowhere, called sprint (who customer service stars past) within four minutes local 602 phoenix number working current sprint phone. canceled nextel service. charging $35 (expected) plus $11.53 taxes, fees assessments &quot;we can't change&quot; couple days called customer service.if buy phone, hope nextel local area code you, don't stuck $46.53 amazon return. pretty color screen though . . . 
 it's nice-looking product. seems like would liked it. but...my unit electrical problem. connected two portable external hard drives, one powered external hard drive, printer, external dvd+-rw drive, mouse keyboard. plugged in.first noticed mouse didn't work. unplugged plugged another one. "that's strange, one doesn't work either," thought. "hmmm, what's smell?" turns out, smell hard drive frying. figured unplugged everything waited.after hours, figured everything would cooled down, started testing devices. one portable external drive still "sort of" works. see file structure copying attempts fail. powered external hard drive mostly worked couple days quit. one portable hard drive never worked again. optical drive still works, occasionally, typically won't boot. occasionally printer works. mice never worked again. keyboard fine. everything's tested 3 different pc systems 1 linux system.the worst part? redundant data storage. lost everything. 
 one, product built cheap. means overtime ports simply stop working...why? i'm really sure...perhaps cheap components, slight bending?secondly, support charging, yet time. plug say apple device you'll get error, charge make sense.this 3.0 usb hub, it's 2.0. many new devices require 3.0 near future. instance, new webcam hates plugged hub performance greatly drops.lastly: mine destroyed, slight drink mishap. nothing seems wrong device than...it stops working time time, sometimes clean ports small amount water get work again..just annoying.- additional notes: stand horrible. won't stay on, especially multiple cords attached pull various directions like power cable. (it falls easily, snap on, it's basically slightly heavy stand "rests" top of. (useless)- glows neon blue. why? i'm sure. like matches setup, it's bright, i'd rather "power" used towards devices.finally: device likely support 7 devices plugged time....i would get 3-4 work...maybe.... given point. eventually two bottom ports simply decided "not work" entirely completely stupid rarely ever used ports begin with. also made think something wrong device, wasted time trouble shooting. (just switch ports) words...don't buy device...get cheaper hub slots, 3.0 hub features.this cheap... 
 tried old bluetrek loved died. actually, killed forgot sat it. impressed advertised battery life, took plunge. shouldn't have. supposed work range 33 feet, found merely put phone opposite side body, connection gets fickle. get lots staticy noise phone 2 feet earpiece direct line sight. sort defeats purpose bluetooth technology, doesn't it? static end; girlfriend complained really even heard it. yo get this, prepared anger party line. plus side, sound nice loud th speaker. that's it. try something else, like bluetrek motorola something. trying motorola next. thing trash. 
 amazon continues ship antenna wilson electronics sleek booster, right antenna. wilson told many times shipping wrong antenna continue it. frustrating caused lot grief able get internet week due amazon's problem. returning whole package amazon even though wilson electronics able send adapter next week so, primary reason purchased product use holidays place staying little reception. able use smartphone hot spot really made angry. excuse amazon told many times wilson electronics sending customers wrong product. 
 claim works sprint pcs got one virgin mobile mc760 won't pick signal! fact actually makes signal weaker! put mc760 window get decent signal thought putting antenna roof would better plug mc760 signal strength goes down! tried connecting spectrum analyzer check doesn't get signals compared another cellphone antenna receive. tried emailing wilson weren't help. another problem cheaply made adapter connects proprietary fme connector antenna cable plugs mc760. try 3 got one would work. first one bad threads wouldn't go way, second one loose center pin pushed back tried connect it. third one finally fit correctly still signal. don't see wilson get away selling worthless junk antennas like this, must get lot consumer fraud complaints. i'm sending useless antenna back refund.i purchased wilson 301101 trucker antenna, mounted magnetic base cb antenna stuck roof works great. one must defective. 
 headset piece junk right box. nothing problems threw away first day. 
 pad extremely unreliable stick dash poorly made. one thing say wallet phone fallen pad. unfortunately, pad moves around. 
 even though package description stated adhesive, certainly white backing remove place dash . felt item thin, touch sticky all. groves competing products part faced supposed attract "stick" smooth. overall, impressed. 
 bought 10 these. worst product ever used. work advertised. nothing sticks

 purchased product send wife trip, complained typing blackberry. thought better install sending her, could guide along. pc is, tried download advertised. result: page found.company advised since discontinued item (?) took support pages.this would issue normally - install driver pc.it principle company maintain manufacturer's description web page support claim...you know manufacturer scumbag feedback/survey link gives error message back...if doubts read blackberry link bottom review page, click one star reviews. shame 
 seems keyboard acts little like gold fish bring home plastic bag pet shop. put whole bag tank acclimates it's new surroundings. went wanting love thing sheer coolness factor....to boxing send back wouldn't sync axim x50v....to giving another chance good ready work flawlessly, love again. keyboard smaller standard useable. it's great writing longer e-mail, inputting contacts, writing letter word, don't want peck screen stylus endlessly. construction feels solid opening closing snap. pun intended. major flaw cradle holds pda. removable desired use space pda little away you. feet clip keyboard don't want let go. plastic it's made doesn't seem especially robust feel certain snap eventually. also curved lower part cradle holds axim, et al, little developed bumped readily jettison it's holding. works well never ceases make grin everyone passing table starbucks stop ask it. previously gave one star, it's acclimated working give 4 cradle shortcoming else would full 5. know shows one star, amazon wholdn't allow edit scale. 
 struggled trying get thing work blackberry 8700g time. even selected downloaded driver listed blackberry devices product web site. lot frustration, finally got blackberry pair keyboard, would still recognize tried get link it. contacted igo product support informed that: "unfortunately, driver device currently." so, ended wasting lot time keyboard supposedly "for blackberry pda/handhelds."by way, carton state works blackberry devices, smartphones. fairly obscure barcode sticker back indicate, small letters, also works blackberry. case, though, back goes, really shame like quality item otherwise sure could made good use it. mean time, guess i'll keep looking.lastly, also agree reviewer vented stupid sticker place unit. glued keyboard front surface quite pain remove.

 won't work phone. 2 hours, got connect, won't answer get calls turn want make them. plus obvious scuff marks device. it's made cheap plastic charger old-fashioned two-prong adaptor. i'm going start looking better device ... especially one charges universal usb adaptor don't carry multiple cords me.

 sound quality excellent, earpiece flimsy irreplacable: terrific electrical engineering, poor mechanical engineering.i loved wasn't broken. even wind didn't seem bother headset much. voice quality great transmission reception. earpiece incredibly flimsy can't replaced. got new headset first time warranty. second time broke could gotten free replacement didn't want hassle. scala i've using months i'm happy it, even though sound wind-immunity doesn't measure logitech. 
 says it's compatible motorola handsets... doesn't work motorola/giant talkabout frs/gmrs/cb 2-way radios 2.5mm jacks. disappointing. 
 phone almost 6 weeks (40 days). 3 weeks middle row keys stopped working (a, s, d, f, g, etc). told call palm india, did, told keys covered warranty.i truly wish making up, really loved palm. fourth palm device, though likely last. run small real estate company works wireless telecom providers throughout nation. hope device could stop carrying three devices (my cell phone, palm t3 laptop). then, guys could stop carrying devices around.of course, took phone sprint, said palm's responsibility repair. raised stink looked blank eyes, always do. sprint seems like business trying run customers off.i called india back raised enough stink, said would give - one time - "free return repair," meaning would without phone 5-10 business days. also gave option paying additional $25 get refurbished replacement, complete 90-day warranty (which know means nothing). people honestly acted like biggest favor offering repair.i effectively called liar palm / india re-emphasize keys don't work, needed something immediately. don't understand made feel like criminal deal people, made feel like they're favor standing behind product. customer! doesn't mean anything anymore?i also sure understand customer service general become bad (though amazon's remains very, good). person spends $400 phone, device, work longer weeks. stop working, company sold stand behind product, instead looking ways squirrel responsibility. subsequent occurrence, friends / colleagues told problems treo 650s, well.there issues phone. box, power/sync cord work. returned sprint got tremendous hassle trying get replaced. (i ended buying seidio charger/cradle, works fine.) sound pretty bad - constantly adjust volume. every often, phone resets - can't figure one all. also, someone calls call-waiting, cannot disconnect active call without disconnecting incoming call; words, accept call-waiting call, automatically means two calls run simultaneously, even first party hangs up. plays heck monthly minutes.also, limited, non-intuitive ways power phone. don't get phone camera: cell phone cameras good placing pictures cell phone.otherwise, palm applications work should, past number years. expect nothing new different palm os part treo.all all, firm opinion never another palm device. company stop using palm, going slowly migrate away sprint (when contracts start expire).my apologies rant, simply seems companies become much bigger customers. excuse let move without me.are companies provide good customer service anymore? know mine tries to; otherwise, we're business. 
 specifically ordered headset eye glass clip. received order, clip would fit glasses, appeared extreme poor contstruction (the type would expect craker jack box).the headset would required pressing button answer call several times would actually pick call.the product process returned amazon.com. 
 bought, exchanged, returned unit. units delivered would turn on. charged using supplied adaptor, red charging light came hours later, unit supposedly fully charged. however, attempted turn unit pressing power button, nothing happened. unit never came on, could paired, never worked. returned them. understand one unit bad, two units shipped several weeks apart shouldn't be.when called technical support, waited hold sometime, gave up. 
 bought item @ local retailer, happy cause got sale (probobly clearance) well worked 2 days wire going unit self would get static touched! find receipt, e-mailed jabra & acting like isn't issue! wanting know many phones tried, tried 1 headset, etc.... prolly get accept return s&h charges stupid & worth replacement! get nice wired headset, less $ spent & less headache! 
 could longer obtain good quality bl-5c's finally gave nokia phone.i think last battery tried one these, actually worse performance battery used year trying replace.these might phonies china old chemically inert, afraid can't recommend these. 
 got timely mannor, put phone, chatged 12+ hours nothing ! never worked ! annoyed say least ! ordered time go hospital ce section wouldnt charge phone often considering bending painfull. lot good me. 
 bought bluetooth back-up pretty pink motorola h500. therefore, placed drawer needed replacement, last night needed it. plugged couple hours tried pair new phone work. charged overnight tried pair nothing (not one indicator light). plugged blue-tooth back charger, steady blue light tried pairing phone charger worked; unfortunately, walk around charger outlet attached head. consequently, lemon due months passed internet purchase, unable return exchange.therefore, moral story test everything purchase internet. learned valuable lesson. 
 device description. looked someone dropped vehicle hit road skidded way down. disappointed opening b/c first thing seen front damage.i email seller told nice refunded returned product back them. 
 unhappy didnt work time got husband heard last 
 bought phone cingular service. needed phone hurry. checked order next day, weird message:"order revisionorder placed october 08, 2005 10:35 pm pdtopen order -- order revision requiredhas approved phone service plan packages. please cancel necessary phone service plan packages order. cannot proceed order without action part. please aware take action item within 5 days, cancelled order.cancel necessary phone service plan packages"i idea cryptic message meant, essentially requiring cancel order. three cell phones family, perfect credit, earthly reason wouldn't approved cell phone account, message explanation. course, one amazon call explanation. don't know form missing information, something mistyped - idea happened. think amazon going cancel order, need explain me.i bought amazon before, usually good service, awful.i think amazon heads cell phone business.from comments, sounds like amazon fully honest transparent cell phone ads. 
 wife purchased v551s migration cingular 6 months ago. time (during phone never dropped, bumped, etc), i've replaced phone twice, once. problems we've include:- random "white screen death"- bluetooth connectivity problems (isolated phones)- dropped calls perfect reception areas- random battery indications- infamous "unable charge" problemadd motorola's lousy phonebook ui, retarded bluetooth handling (e.g., bt device connected, moto default ring sounds, regardless sound profile caller-specific ringtones), overpriced, overhyped, oversize paperweight.i'm fortunate cingular offers company's employees discounts new phones, go back sony ericsson. old t616 gave 2 years perfect service, even dropped twice. it's 2nd owner now, used 6 months problem-free. 
 doesn't stay even figure get on. ear plug piece big bulky can't hear. mouth piece way short one hear talk car road noise. cord short volume control cord inconvenient. get bluetooth give wire. 
 fell apart one use, person called couldn't even hear wasn't broken pieces. disappointed! :( 
 model, c150, one 4 jabra headsets ordered. continued try different jabra models ear piece far comfortable best sound quality ever used, however, 4 jabras poor microphone quality. one, persons end could hear me. disappointed. found worked well cell phone, cordless phone. 
 screwed up; shouldn't ordered this; it's use me. since real price hidden "shipping handling" it's pointless return it; i'll write "educational expense".i actually bought use cordless handset "hands free" 2.5mm jack. (siemens cordless phone system). owners manual says "...any 2.5 mm headset", that's bought. don't even know thing anymore; put back little bag forgot it.i tried three handsets system; plug simply captures line makes loud, "screeching" sound... ...playing plug, find one tenuous position quarter way hear audio phone, moment let slip goes back screeching.i can't get work anything else either including wife's samsung intensity (which also 2.5mm headset jack; results), don't access palmevery often something stupid; buying one occasions. 
 work since day got them.the right earbud never sound.i got replacement, it's situation.i sure it's i'm using nokia e71x, don't work properly. 
 there's problem design headset. jack used short. it's extremely sensitive movement. don't plugged way keep still, you'll loose connection. don't know designed way... 
 3rd "oem" battery bought via amazon marketplace -- others, terrible. ordered form oem shop br50. sent br56 supposed even better 3 hours talk time. last 30 minutes complete overnight charge. nowhere long battery trying replace lasts hour instead original 2 1/2 hours.oem sent counterfeit fake battery --- oem. tell? motorola oem batteries made japan. say clearly made china. problem returned battery wireless phone accessories batteries4less.amazon_- screening sellers addressing issues. ton posts every single one motorola razr battery listing say got bad counterfeit batteries.theses companies make money selling junk, counting amazon customer feel worth hassle return it. every one return lose hour time. time worth th $10 get ripped for. anyway b/c hopefully point amazon going take responsibility conduct market sellers. amazon's new logo become customer centric company earth. well amazon, start here: bargain cell -- one worst offenders, wireless phone accessories oem shop -- joke name last one since clearly know selling counterfeit batteries.i paid $30 one batteries4less hoping get real deal -- got exact batter got oem shop -- exact counterfeit. nothing price paid. dishonest online sellers. 
 agree reviews... people talk hear horrible echo due mic picking earspeakers sound... even set earspeaker lowest volume. i'm glad came free phone, i'd payed this... i'd pretty mad. 
 summary: stay away, product sports poor design...pro:+ low price+ small lightweight+ relatively easy use+ pair well bt phonescon:- morse-code like feedback signal - try accomplish many tasks single beep/tone. 1 short beep, 2 short beeps, 3 short beeps, 1 long beep, 3 beeps up, 3 beeps down. like another reviewer said, really read manual keep nearyby able understand beeping means.- echos matter volume set it, partly thing loud- insanely difficult open battery door. got frustrated, throw thing window. product use regular batteries, battery door difficult open. opened, need pair tweazers pull battery out. battery compartment deep extremely snug. must sick joke motorola. forget changing battery go, need sit tools lot patience. (for record: breaking point, return unit, installing battery first time enough turn-off)- sound quality mediocre best 
 tried putting galaxy s4 case kept popping out. seems like plastic casing small phone. disappointed. 
 returned came dented. like , wish could used it. said got last one. 
 product pretty inexpensive expectations. received quickly noticed flimsy plastic was. probably fit 2 credit cards top. might good case nights out, probably wont protect phone much. ended tossing flimsy. 
 case took almost week arrive. buy cheap case, you're going get cheap case quality. stay away. inside case contacts phone smooth all. scratch phone. looks someone dropped dirt. could clean whatever gunk case. thank god didn't scratch aluminium case. credit card didn't even slide way case. good luck trying fit two there. spend money else where. 
 phone fit junky case properly. completely worthless money grab seller. cheap coupon code doesn't fit! tossed case trash belongs. realize purchasing cheap case gamble, never expected bad doesn't even fit phone. completely useless. 
 worst product ever seen motorola. charges phone hold jack goes phone, also drive time.i bought belkin's similar product walmart $10 rocks. 
 bought one second time plugged light end went stopped working! thing junk, way replace fuse (if one) without destroying it. tried take apart, can't without breaking it. genuine motorola product stupid design. break open hope get back together toss it??? never problem car charger 10+ years owned cell phone, tell something! screw one up?! hire idiot designed one thats how! 
 omg got smallest piece junk ever paid :) really charger died 2 weeks pluged car.the charger made cheap plastic,light weight right worthless. 2 weeks pluged in,it never gave phone full charge,i drove 63 miles pluged phone yet still fully charge it.guess get pay for.so want more,then you'll pay more. 
 like barely sticks cigarette plug passat, close cover don't phone chord plugged in.even 2.1 port, charger cannot keep iphone 5s. every thing iphone (air plane mode, screen off, etc), gave 15% charge 2 hours. that's 7.5% per hour.when using waze gps charge drops 100% 90% 10 minutes.i would recommend charger. 
 product quality item very, poor. charging phone 15 minutes charger began overheat charge phone started fail. return item refund. 
 bought use brand new 2014 nissan altima. first time plugged in, worked jiggled right. definitely 2.0 amp charger either. spend extra dough get one directly t-mobile retailer. worth return shipping cost refund. buy feel like donating money foreign company asia, fun. 
 leather, smell atrocious. however, you're okay leatherette, nice pockets inside it's relatively thin/lightweight.i'd avoid seller though (boxwave corp). shipping $5 pay return item them. me, total waste money shipping costs alone likely far product worth. paid $30 case, $5 shipping me. i'll sending flat rate back. bear mountain cases better, real leather, cost less (about $20 ipad mini). 
 classic book iphone case flimsy cover remain closed. good protection iphone. 
 perhaps got bad one, thing won't consistently work 4 feet away phone, let alone 30 claim. it's nice design, worked i'd happy it.update: got new bt250v amazon kind enough exchange unit sight unseen (they even shipped new unit i'd shipped back bad one). unfortunately, new unit works somewhat better, still doesn't work well should. example, noticeable popping (interference) put phone pocket, even side headset. i've tried many combinations phone headset, time problem headset, i'm quite sure it's issue phone, bluetooth general. (in fact, i've far better luck jabra bt products.) so, design beautiful product great works, i've found fails really need it.final update: chucked it. don't believe breathless reviews this. use everyday life--i.e. phone feet head--people end hear static. got sick people asking "what's clicking sound?" threw stupid thing away. i'm amazed people love much. must floored idea wireless technology haven't actually tried using real conversation, haven't actually tried call another person. two bad experiences company, last jabra product i'll ever buy. 
 range headset pathetic - maybe 2 3 feet phone get decent signal (which defeats entire puprpose cordless headset imho). otherwise, horrific - static, terrible sound quality, etc. please waste money pos. swapped moto h850 much happier unit paired motoe815. 
 bt250 newer bt250v pure junk. sound quality two units horrid, ways describe it. friends coworkers identify units remotely asked speak using bt250 bt250v. microphone sooooo sensitive un-tuned, particularly unusable cars walking. road noise wind noise saturate voice. even ideal quiet surrounding, normal speech come muddy weak. battery life also shortens significantly 1 year warranty moderate use. button unit doesn't help usability. earhook design, one would push button direction perpendicular ear activate button, task easily done one finger pain. however, unit uses behind ear design, would use two fingers motion pinch earlobe activate button, it's truly unpleasant experience. addition, vibrate alert feature stupid useless. cases, one would wearing unit, audible ringing heard--why would need vibrate???i truly advise buying unit. 
 one worthless items i've ever had. troubleshooting information manual. works wants opposed want. charge doesn't seem last day without use. whoever thought blue flashing light ear stylish get lobotomy.i give bluetooth. mostly, nomo motoone star can't give lower vote. 
 returned product clearly used headset. scratches front, small dent. frankly want insert used product ear. went wal-mart bought product less money. 
 headset sound quality poor. end pick handset manually hear person end. defeats purpose hands free car. quiet room works fine. buy intend use car, bus train. 
 long-time motorola bluetooth headset user, tell painful experience fundamental flaws hs850. fact, went four hs850 headsets (under warranty) motorola decided upgrade h700 (despite lower model number, h700 newer model).the hs850 h700 characteristics:- over-the-ear swing arm earpiece used left right ear- flip-open boom microphone turns headset on/off- easy volume controls- toggle switch connect/disconnect calls (or put hold/mute)- easy pairing- good published battery life- standard motorola power connectorswhat's difference? well, "good published" battery life distinction. four hs850 headsets worked weeks months, would hold charge. battery life went minutes.dealing motorola support nightmare. apparently, support center products argentina, could script help me. fourth failure, insisted getting support contact corporate hq illinois. support contact dream. reviewing case, gave h700 replacement. headset 1.5 years, kept battery life functionality. course, lost buy replacement...and given choices, got another h700.do fall lower price hs850. i've seen prices low $15 model. think you'll frustrated disappointed end. 
 treo 650, sprint pcs, firmware update 1.08for part, actually like headset comfy, people seem hear well (the comfort big deal, often wear glasses)however, headset takes long time connect t650 --- good 7 10 seconds calls (and then, people hung up)in addition, volume okay car (or isolated places) forget using outside noiser environmentsi've heard works well moto products though ---- treo 650 users, highly recommend scala 500, fast connection times loud volumehappy shopping!!! 
 sucks.... want even keep one. first use non usb charger big bulk needs put trashed buried another planet. 
 sound horrible... people say sound like muffled tunnel. bought two, case bt ran down.... poor me..... plantronics 620 works like cr*p too. noise cancellation worth d*mn... forget using driving car.... trying find new one... 
 even though ear piece designed razor phone, ear bud big, uncomfortable keeps falling ear. two weeks use, on/off switch stopped working, feature main reason bought unit. sum, waste money. provision review "0" stars, gave "1" 
 don't see others liked this. doesn't add value -- doesn't make phone easier carry use, doesn't add significant protection, anything else. i'd recommend getting pouch slide-on clip, holds phone horizontally belt waistband. 
 ****updated oct. 18, 2010*sigh*i really tried make work worth hassle. previously speculated, wonder wearing glasses reason poor fit. traveled quite bit last weekend found that, often not, headset disconnected phone call. hands-free-device turned pull-over-and-muck-with-it-after-each-call burden. maybe didn't obscure setting correct looked couldn't find one. maybe mine defective, i'm sure really trouble worth. almost ten years ordering amazon taking advantage return policy first time.i found different headset 73% still $40 (orig $150 / plantronics discovery 925 bluetooth earpiece gold) comes chargeable case. never seen case protects also charges! colors bit more. check one wear glasses. fits ear, top, hoping better fit.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *i expecting reading reviews.let first say sound quality excellent. sent voice-mail rolling windows freeway without appreciable loss sound quality! amazing could barely tell difference "all windows up" "driver/passenger window down."however.... wear glasses rounder face. difficult place earpiece ear glasses on. bulky part doesn't sit well glasses' frame. mouthpiece adjustable. fuller cheeks mic comes contact face. sure made way since faces same. control buttons also difficult manage driving. main control side fine tiny on/off volume buttons hard find press without dislodging unit. turn place ear. maybe something sitting eyeglasses frame. like sound quality continue use coming back update. doesn't work well i'm sure one kids like it. (i ended returning it. see above)would also recommend getting case corral charger unit one place. 
 many people complained, found headset's microphone weak. person hear all. contacted plaintronics repair. repair process tracking, sending headset address. two weeks later, received used one back, one sent in, packaged oem box. although one better microphone new one sent in, battery reliable hold charge, also battery portion kind loose.i recommend plantronics product all. 
 jabra first came out, battery stopped charging 10 months. got one replacement, stopped charging year. problem bt earpieces, battery replaceable done industry wants to. make money selling whole unit vs pay 5-10 dollars replace battery. kind practice sustainable. i'm back wired headset. 
 tried two headsets horrible person speaking to. heard echo worse others, heard it. heard every word said repeated back nearly loud voice. annoying say least thank amazon amazing taking headsets back! 
 unfortunately, purchased mine $100 never able use it. didn't return right away thought would able read directions came figure unmute it, never able to. hear people, can't hear me. matter do, won't unmute. buttons small difficult use it's ear. finally got different bluetooth works fine. 
 razr v2 best cell phone ever graded razr v3 late last year (2007). razr v3 far worst cell phone i've owned. beautiful great features keeps failing 5 phones far (the original purchased one plus 4 refurbished replacements) 1st phone: couple months screen would light / 2nd phone would charge get go / 3rd phone month screen would longer light / 4th phone couple months screen would light / 5th phone working month now. really like razr phones, work v3 model terrible would rate lower 1 star possible. 
 purchased three 2 weeks. phone great, problem: battery doesn't stay firm place phone turns every 5 minutes. 
 searched "droid 3 chargers" making purchase. first product pop up, decent reviews, cheap. purchased 3. product arrived time. however product fit droid 3 phones. contacted customer service course 9 times. results replacement, return refund. contactd phone w/in first 2 min convo f-bomb dropped twice. offensive unprofessional. needles say, 3 chargers dont fit phones. anyone wanna trade? 
 looking for, therefore sent back. work droid razr maxx. 
 yea sound great, bluetooth signal awesome crystal clear hiss pop fading out. bad part headband breaks reason using it. got $50 piece junk can't use 
 people said, headphones bit heavy ears. 3 weeks crack headband started, 2 months crack big headphones stopped working. try returning replacement don't see why, design isn't smart headband cracking place stress. reinforced one spot.it's shame sound really top notch used able connect ipod leave bag, connect pc via 'bluetooth advanced audio' disturb wife i'm killing zombies half-life 2. 
 data, thick stiff cable, get pay for, keep looking better cable reviews pass 
 crap buy work phones paid four dollars. trashed 
 received today a1 accessories. bought solely use xbox live wouldn't keep moving headset use work (i work home). friends kept asking repeat myself. one said turn tv volume could hear (no lie). switched back headset back crystal clarity. that, threw one trash.. good thing cost $5 so. 
 model, c250 earwave boom, one 4 jabra headsets ordered. continued try different jabra models ear piece far comfortable best sound quality ever used, however, 4 jabras poor microphone quality. one, persons end could hear me. disappointed. ended getting ge tl26593 earset microphone jasco, best far. 
 (updated)+ good battery life+ comfortable (choice two ear bud tips, plus extras)+ easy use+ minimal bling appeal (blue light obtrusive)- first unit failed (charger, headset buggy) 3 weeks use- jabra support lackluster- ugly shiny mic piece (photo amazon accurate, see customer images)after three weeks use, stopped charging ac adapter. dropped audio connections dialing, 20 minutes conversation. (replacement unit also exhibited this, less.) contacted jabra charging issue, required a) return headset rma, b) send new one. less month use. found another way get replacement (boomerang purchase local chain 'tronics store.)on plus side, lasts standby days (vice hours like sony bt headset does). fits around ear, comfortably ear, easily. loop soft rubber, sharp rigid plastic clamping outer ear. sound quite loud enough (the volume controls easy find touch, in-ear speaker blast much), earbud gently pressed form seal, easier hear way. sound so-so, callers told can't hear there's ambient sound, music, wind, cars nearby. all, better average, second jabra product that's crapped me, wary. (i recommend always owning wired headset backup, particularly business important personal use.)** july 2008 update **i've used 2 years give much better review. unit held well (though tip broke glued back). still holds several hours charge, old sony headset lasts one 10 minute conversation dies. shape, weight, ergonomic fit unobtrusive i've companions remind i'm still wearing hanging call. although didn't like shiny "bling" microphone tip, i've softened design. bt500 still attractive less attention getting others. headset work, new car handsfreelink feature, use unit home, two years, still works great. recommend headset without reservation. (disclosure: use nokia 6682, tested phone models.) 
 used less week charged 3 times. fourth try green light disappeared wouldn't turn on.i bought loved jabra 250 still use it, matter fact.i really disappointed something like (for price paid it) would stop working good reason.i should've bought plantronics.don't waste money this. 
 hate phone...i drawn it's appearance size horrible dissapointment. get motorola mobile tools 'hack' volume could hear - loudest default setting low. display impossible see outside bright light, detest poor means displaying missed calls, caller attempted reach multiple times, displays last call time only. returned phone replacement dust display screen, told 'known' issue, replacement phones warranty expire month time original purchased. 
 hype says:"getting internet easy razr v3 supports cingular's gsm-based wireless internet express service. used cingular data plan phone's bluetooth usb data capability, phone used wireless modem laptops pdas."i say:caca! plan connecting internet using phone bluetooth better get mongo battery laptop it's slowest, laggiest, painfully irritating, useless piece doggy doo ever displeasure using! could run seattle knock amazon's front door faster connecting site.update: 6/7/2006i tested actual bandwidth connect 39.1 kbps, that's slower dialup 56k (53.3) modem. connected cingular's gsm says connected 115.2 kbps connect via bluetooth 230 kbps use usb cable. either way actual speed 39-41 kbps surely don't patience that.one last annoying feature ... cingular "brands" phones can't download games phone delete certain ringtones etc., providers. also annoying "hellomoto" video/commercial uses 25% available space videos own. way delete recapture waste space. truly worst product ever purchased. 
 like previous motorola phones i've had, one easy intutive system navigating numerous menus --- i'm sold using motorola reason, compared noxxxx, motorola great!pros:almost everythingawesome designgsmi found volume excellent compared last phone (motorola v60).good antenna, extremely low rate dropped signals --- also, since antenna protrude, anticipate require replacement (i replace antenna twice old v60 --- broke carrying pocket and/or dropping)excellent color screen.good camera phone.great size, easily fits shirt pocket.great battery life (with bluetooth off)easily customizable items never use (media mall, media net, etc.) remain prominent place put obscure location.cons:the significant negative feature screen --- extremely hard see sunlight.display front (when closed) hard read.price (if upgrading phone cingular --- wanted $199) however, since changing at&t; cingular able buy phone bestbuy $70.the manual comes better writen.screen gets oily normal use must wiped frequently.alarm clock interface could better.date book alert loud.accessory support cingular stores rather poor --- two cingular stores usb cable (had buy one wal-mart).of four five phones owned, one far best respects. even cons still eons ahead phones.edit: change 5 stars 1 star... loved features phone flip lid great. problem: 3 months screen would light --- took phone back at&t; sent reconditioned phone lasted month --- took one back, sent another reconditioned phone, long story > short: 5 phones one year, 5th phone finally worked kept working couple years. experience phone, buy another motorola. 
 cable ultra thin must shielded well. can't find perfect spot put ipod within 2 foot circumference cable - get ton interference. even find good spot still interference occasionally. another cable (non-retractable) foot long works fine - know interference something cable. 
 update:this silly 3.5mm cord lasted 3 months audio went retractor went cheap quality would buy went old standard non retractable cord 
 first all, ordered item image showed white black. ordered specifically match white iphone. thing fell apart taking box. returning garbage getting $5.00 back. last time ever purchase scosche product! 
 seller lost package facility took 2 months receive it. bought gift i'm glad took long get here. it's flimsy gets really tangled really easy. avoid costs. 
 bought plantronics 320 today. soon walked store,the reception went static beyond belief. salesman said "give chance", it's going back tomorrow. past week i've bought 4 headsets(motorola 500,850,700,& one one worst.i found motorola 700 best far. clear reception time,excellent volume(no problem hearing driving),& always connected treo 650. windy day friend end didn't even know got car,hardly background noise. ordered 700 amazon,much cheaper cingular & motorola. 
 unit looks big photo, brace yourself: it's like bad science fiction rocket ship arrives. made hard plastic odd fins protrusions everywhere. rest easily head. feels heavy abrasive. surprised none manufacturers come softer, lighter material, spent time considering fit headset ears head. sony better job drbt21g/b, also falls victim hard plastic hinge middle set digs skull time goes on. truly astonishing.i could get unit pair top-of-the-line sony bluetooth transmitter. motorola "kind" enough issue stern warning returning item without calling toll-free number. waste time. either don't answer hone, leave hanging long periods time hold. 
 got amazon. treo700wx(sprint) set breeze comfort earpiece excellent. however, keep losing connection 640 headset treo. headset beeps ear everytime connection lost happens often. double checked connection everything set per instructions. wondering defective unit anyone else experiencing problems. 
 well, idea sound like. wont work phone! connector made ericsson phone, stated anywhere description. however cheap, really cant complain much. 
 i'm third z520a six months i've owned it. reason haven't gone i've accepted phone lemon. phone freezes can't shut off, requiring removal battery reset, frequently drops calls, doesn't always let place calls, plain weird things result unreliable frustrating call experience. even annoying purchased expensive, model-specific accessories become useless paperweights replace new phone - phone additional hundreds on, mention cost accessories. i'll never buy another sony ericsson product. 
 design good would excellent product quality anything terrible. buttons extend arms worked exactly one time breaking. press press nothing happens. it's shame rest works decently.the suction cup holds well tube coming cup pretty sturdy. moves lot car moving would need rest dash would help somewhat perfectly.overall one star poor quality worthless spite good points. 
 even seemed flimsy first got stuck trying figure worked. get unstuck thought problem solved, wrong.after using couple days completely stuck longer functional. pretty upset husband really wanted work vehicle go searching another one hopefully don't run problem. 
 purchased phone cingular carry new razr mp3 player 1.3 megapizel camera settle one. swivel use keypad awful, one ever hear talking, (even use motorola h700 bluetooth headset), photos taken regular megapixel camera phone better 1.3 provided here, can't listen mp3 thru bluetooth, photos stored phone often become corrupted reason all, photos disappear occassionally turn phone back on, bulky heavy, battery times drains hour even without use, reception poor often stand wide open areas. overall, disappointed phone wish contract would allow trade in. gadget junkie reviews cnet led purchase phone truly regret it. go new motorola razr 1.3 camera mp3 player, features nice slim package. 
 everything works fine, sustain less two days lightweight use (most time standby status)i ordered two sony ericsson w600i wirefly, bundled cingular family share plan. phone locked cingular.talked sony ericsson support service, sony doubted may problem battery phone them.talked wirefly, decided exchange. 
 case garbage. got whats pictured. also nothing lined up. sent back promply. would purchase again. 
 watch people -- notched circular connection ear cushions fit opening plantronic voyager pro -- diameter small, fall out. however ordered "medium gel eartips",plantronics medium eartips voyager pro [3 pack] pack 3, connector fit. i'm keeping gel eartips (not item) throwing foam ones. 
 idea mean "motorola retail packaging", beware picture website. received headset loose plastic bag, along instructions charger. charger ripped it's bag used (the cord obviously re-wrapped secured grocery store bag tie).when complained amazon receiving used merchandise, immediately sent replacement via overnight, customer service person could cared less amazon selling used/returned merchandise.i received replacement today. doesn't look used, plastic baggie - packaging like webite shows. bought christmas present wife (to go pink razr) - i'm sure going impressed plastic baggie packaging. sure hope works better looks! really bad, amazon, really bad. 
 threw terrible volume/clarity ends. go scala 500- bought second (lost first) it's best market. 
 got lot static noise. connection good either. put phone within 6 inches away ear piece get better reception. regret buying it. one useless item money go drain. 
 reviews product good one piece would likely broke easily per reviews price point decided return it. 
 doesn't work, phone keep showing invalid battery. wasted money! thought returning it, it's cheap, don't bother. 
 wearing mintues, got blister swelling ears. insulator. hurt back ears bad notice blister. don"t know motorolla called themselve engineer. don"t need rocket scientist kind pads insulator protect skin 
 got defective purchase item still awaiting rma seller. really comfortable product wear. can't comment product never worked date. say bad buy rig comfortable wear. say look products meet needs. 
 upgraded nokia 6600 (which loved wasn't hottest looking phone) also motorola a630. phone nice, dainty, great display, ends there:*) speaker isn't loud enough, you're always pressing phone ear incredibly hard still can't hear well - called t-mobile, acknowledged problem sent instructions phone increase speaker volume avail.*) slider hard get quickly - try sliding phone open, many times actually reject call.*) using call waiting isn't bad - go call waiting easy, retrieving call painful*) text messages - worst ever - first, slide phone open, create message, hit enter key, recent log, select recipients, next enter message sends. nokia create message, hit green button, enter destination, hit green button.*) deleting messages worse! select message, hit options, hit delete (sometimes it's 4, sometimes 6), "are sure", hit yes, done. nokia, select message hit "c" instantly done.*) bluetooth - it's supposed convenient, no, always asked want connect - thing auto-connect! every time get car get phone pocket unlock phone, hit yes, i'll nagged every seconds noise. oh, hit (when someone else car don't want calls going car) it'll ask 5 seconds. arrrgh!this baby going back! i'm gonna try blackberry 8700. 
 ordered 2 couple weeks ago, got decent time put phone charged them, neither battery lasted 48hrs max less 10 mins talk time.sent email company nice sent 2 batteries plus return envelope send first two back with, put next ones, charged thing within 48hrs batteries dead virtually zero talk time them.sending 4 back.im guessing basically get pay for. 
 don't get wrong h3 looks good sleek gives much feed back. mean phone, party hears echo. happend calls. thing kept returning lost receipt threw away box! don't recomend wasting money this. one may try worked h500. cheap looks ok best all, works!!!! oh yeah razor hard time linking h3. 
 bought direct amazon, "unlocked" phone technically unlocked, cingular-branded firmware.for anyone familiar that, "branded" euphemism "hacked carrier remove features replace useful menu options links buy stuff." guess "branded" shorter saying that.this "clean" l7. may well buy unlocked cingular phone ebay.i yet checked features see removed phone, although immediately notice even signed java applications require constant "permission", unbranded phone would accept verisign certificate. 
 pouch felt clumsy. extra play phone could wiggle around in. also clip thin it's good sweatpants scrubs. weight phone, flip it's clipped onto belt. 
 first headset sent doa. told pay return shipping replacement unit would sent out. received another unit guess what..... correct another defective unit. tried contacting seller multiple times responded. anybody want good deal broken headset? 
 product arrived time several people including personnel verizon, apple could get connect phone. sent back. 
 bluetooth headset probably one worst ever waste money on.for odd reason motorola bluetooth, including one really really bad static.i cannot clearly hear person person cannot hear me.i would save money buy different brand altogether.motorola h700 bluetooth headset 
 saw reviews headset cnet, pretty excited getting use lg vx-9400 phone. verizon sales agent recommended h700 version bluetooth. reason gave jabra bt350v lots static using 9400.well, results h700 actually worse. callers end said static painful ears bad. heard static end never case headset phone pairing i've had. one day, boxed back sent back amazon.one thing note. must taken context phone paired with. using lg vx-9400, experience likely different. possible, find headset others already used phone reported success with. otherwise rolling dice. sites like howard forums (google it) good finding others experienced. good luck! 
 purchased product dive trip fiji. fiji decided take kayak camera inside 'waterproof' case. case sitting legs trip slid water. water maybe 2&#34; deep. didn't even completely submerge case. ways wanted take picture resort. lifted case knew issue right away water came pouring out.my camera ruined 2nd day 10-day vacation. place find another camera. would better putting camera pocket case.do purchase item! 
 motorola better. product would install ether state art computers. find program another source. save headaches. 
 i'd like say satisfied device, i'm not, att version whatever reason sooo much better phone tracfone, basically phone.just stupid phone!!!the att version good, good phone!!hello guys, reviews today phone used tracfone motorola c139.1st phone, worked good, bathroom flushed toilet went phone, course dead gone sewer.2nd phone. phone at&t; service, instead tracfone, noticed possible ui change, better service fact could use prepaid personal at&t; put sim lock pay go sim cards.the phone wasn't good texting pretty good also games, got addicted one ball kind like brick attack, found keyocera phones, totally forget name.3rd phone, tracfone got sister, washed hose, fell got sprayed red dot prove this. got screen change colors call different people contacts, tried drying stopped even working even phone, would go tracfone turn screen reset something like press button itd go off, battery would die.it still mysteriously charged, used moto charger, planned found phone battery get lit keypad. took apart, voided warranty, since wet. got nothing figured replace recycle did. 
 beware tracfone. regret amazon won't let give 0 stars. got phone wife's aunt last december. 1 year trying get working, still cannot receive calls. call out, one call her. tracfone support useless (and generally marginally speaks english). also cannot manage phone minutes line. call give 60 digits phone shows almost anything. we're letting one die 400 units left basically useless. coverage isn't good either, cares can't receive calls anyway? got better option, doubt many worse ones. 
 sucks, never worked, hated it, threw away. total waste time- many better products there. 
 poor product quality. lost iphone 3gs due water leak using product. working ok occasion sometime (couple months using) stop working water start leak. 
 bought cruise protect phone, cash delicate items cruise. 5 minutes water noticed 1/4 full water. bottom developed hole extremely light use. cost? ruined iphone 5s. nightmare. guess stupid trust 12 dollar &#34;waterproof&#34; pouch 600 dollar iphone. lesson learned. 
 don't buy adapter!! picture shown receive, picture shows genuine nokia adapter get cheap piece crap doesn't even specifications nokia adapter. don't want fry device, don't buy this. 
 want warn professionals verizon wireless phone data email service inappropriately spoofing sender's email address messages sent motorola q. creating problems anti-spam filters also believe unethical illegal. recommend buying phones data/email service organization.when configure imap server option motorola q phone owned one executives, verizon system "spoofing" email address messages sent email server. external spoofed internal messages get blocked anti-spam filters.when wanted try "white list" (unblock) verizon servers anti-spam server, technical support verizon representatives refused give us ip addresses servers email messages sent. probably refused network administrators security concerns don't blame this. i'm sure agree problem instead resolved within verizon's system software solution.instead spoofing desired email address, messages coming verizon phones distinct "from" "reply-to" addresses, first external verizon wireless address, latter customer's desired commonly used email address. two must differ messages end spam sender won't spoofed.although q seems like good device, advise purchase don't support email integration organization verizon wireless makes "from" "reply-to" fields configurable. small shops microsoft exchange loose anti-spam settings probably won't problems like this. 
 reluctantly getting 3rd q (replacement). i've 2nd one maybe 2 months. would freeze constantly past 2 months forcing remove battery restart. dreaded black screen death "motorola flash mode bootloader version: boot_c_03.08.00r_mpap". anytime bloggers start naming phone dies bad sign! 
 phone experience:its light sleek perform well basic phone, charge every 2 days 2 times day use smartphone.this phone's interfaces old looks like using old bulky nokia phones specially switching smart-phone. slow limited capabilities. krzr seems lot better interfaces.verizon experience:at least getting many dropped calls cingular. much better reception.some things encountered far are: verizon charges 1 month advance monthly access fee, first month activation cost $250-300 excluding phone cost. next, charged $15 ported old number, past received service free t-mobile cingular.customer service friendly all.amazon experience:the sad part story starts received phone.i opened box looked like used phone, dust inside plastic protector edges coming scratches mini-sd card goes. thought big deal called verizon, came resolution couple calls hold time goto store free replacement. went store, lady kept trying nothing happened answer oh may bought phone amazon customer service take this.ha, don't know earth amazon don't care customer satisfaction all. one help you. emails lost hopes stuck phone.now think shouldn't bought here, thru verizon least get new phone.my 2 cents don't buy here, worth buying verizon directly long term. 
 bought two one charging use one.big mistake!!! stop charging reasonsit works ok months. 
 keeps flling ear. work past 4 feet. bought jabra 125 love 
 sound garbles badly battery runs within hour. neat looking headset functional. 
 buy handsfree. give damaged product...and send other...and damaged tooo..i buy nokia products never send damaged product.. quality department samsung???dont buy samsung products!!! please wise!!!! 
 bought headset recommendation picky friend, figured would great. wrong. ear loop cumbersome put on, ear bud stay average ear. worse, place headset recharging box (???? happened simple plug??), meaning ear loop needs come off. jabra ear gel fits unit . . . ear piece needs come recharge. nail coffin ear piece volume terribly low, necessitating constant shove finger ensure aural leakage, even ultra-quiet toyota sequoia. fair, sound quality reported good, drawbacks far outweigh pluses. 
 ordered thing sep 19th. ship oct 26th! don't even get started stupid reasons customer service gave stock item took long ship. anyway, finally got it. excited great reviews read. saw ear hook, like what! flimsy piece cr@p! thought myself, "this going break soon use it, better leave on." utter amazement! take charge dumb thing! second charge, guess what? broke! big surprise! hold unit ear use it, fall out. ear hook great, thing still fell even ear hook. can't really comment well thing works, can't keep charged. first complete charge, died one phone call. hour phone call, gee whiz! 5th bluetooth ear piece, little experience things. biggest complaint others low speaker volume noise interference. wish would chance test one it's going back amazon. maybe file rma wait month half ship back them. lol! 
 case worthless motorola hs815 headset. every time put headset case, case squeezes activation button headset. maybe work headsets activation button outside surface. 
 used motorola h500 worked well phone. unfortunately misplaced it. eventually bought another one via amazon. got it, worked hissing crackle sound. thought phone problem would eventually go away. not. suppose brand new headset. it's defective return immediately. i'm giving supplier 1 star. 
 acted thought muted wasn't. tried two separate cell phones thing phones. person called could hear first syllable it. try turn mute off, change frequency buzzing sound person heard. 
 agree device works advertised sound quality pretty decent headset caused heartache annoyances outweigh benefit. buy prepared device turn opportune times..... want turn off, thats whole different story. powering device requires holding button certain period time problem time required seems change time it. add holding button period time shorter period time required turn actually redial function. frequently called someone trying turn device. button also entirely sensitive. i've device cargo pants pocket (where would little pressure device) unit turned actually called someone.other issues charging indication isn't real clear isn't idea knowing charged battery device isn't quite comfortable devices used (its bearable definately comfortable money). 
 thought thing would great small could use normal chargers broke soon bought it. 
 product came without shipping slip, protective packaging. .bluetooth placed plastic bag, slipped envelope mailed. quality poor. crackling, buzzing muffled sounds annoying diapointing recieve something expecting use time able use it. would recomend vendor anyone. description stated clearly would packaged retai packaged pictured extra items. came bluetooth charge cord; instruction accessories this. 
 although weight, sound battery good, really dislike headset's design. totally predictable person thing every day never gets dirt cuffs, it's ok. go, wire clip come loose pocket computer bag. pen holder doesn't anything shield clip, fact adds weight causes force exposed headset. recrimp loop make tight enough come loose. pen cap required baggage good reason. rather give standard mini usb connector device, must haul cap everywhere. hey, don't always wear shirt pockets. two weeks misplaced trip expensive headset sitting shelf ponder whether buy another useless pen clip cook connector. excuse non-standard connectors charging solutions, watch company again.(several months later) finally tossing headset. pen clip holder eventually found tried make go device. don't like get rid working items, earpiece ear hook fall many times pocket last time, fell elsewhere lost. would believe couldn't even stand pressure inside suit coat? get box carry in, cumbersome charging holder, doesn't matter would buy new hook earpiece. ordered motorola h500, lower cost, lots color choices long talk time plus standard mini usb jack. got travel case less $4. got one daughter xmas proved better headset. 
 sound horrible car. fiancee said sounded like bubbling noises talking via headset. called home left message answering machine. horrible! could hardly hear sounded like bubbles fish tank. garbage. mileage may vary, would highly recommend consider different headset. 
 really don't lot time. shop online, i'm purchasing item used make life convenient, like bluetooth headset, really obnoxious receive one &#34;worse sucks&#34;. item even charge. plantronics really needs pull item really damaging reputation sale. choose plantronics regional sales manager/road warrior, i've always luck plantronics. bad one lemon. 
 product junk. less month stopped working. dont waste money. 
 arrived went plug noticed one prongs bent. went bend back broke! noticed rust base broken prong. i'm sending back refund won't buying another one. 
 work iphone 3gs all. first time tried said accessory optimized iphone. think amazon remove listing. 
 buy charger. probably never see review nobody wants know charger apple device!! destroy it! 
 money waste? buy item. broken 2nd day use stand phone. rated 1 star less 
 wouldn&#8217;t recommend item white.....it discolored within one week purchase. case discolored quick normal use. 
 last one week....the belt clip made cheap plastic...! like kick stand watch movies it....do buy....d 
 work well cheap. sending back today! waste cash product all. got many better quality cases different places amazon one. 
 snapped belt clip less week getting car. problem many style cases have, look metal clips instead plastic. real problem note 2 big enough matter time snags something matter careful are. clip cheap weak, phone going floor holster worthless clip snaps off. 
 case belt phone slid right busted pavement. get real caste. 
 soon wrote recommeded product broke, quite 3months, need relacement already, understand customers concerns now, could stand test time! 
 well got boxwave holster went use first time today crack side want replace ment please send replace ment ( belt clip side case crack ) 
 cheap clip broke less week. first day, clip/kickstand popped off. clipping belt, natural movement going day would pop clip case phone would hit ground. days clip popping off, putting back on, plastic held clip broke. definitely wouldn't recommend this. 
 received 7th, broke 10th. didn't hit anything catch anything. stay away cheaply made garbage. 
 case would ok fit. none holes line up, camera slot, stylis port etc. gladly accept another holster fit correctly. phone large need belt clip. 
 bought three different tpu cases lg g2. case simply fit. top bottom stay tight phone bulges. also, case form fit nice curved sides phone. 
 ordered case 9 days ago..it arrived yesterday. tracking give tracking number.....wheres case.. charged card product.. 
 review boxwave case stand. reason say boxwave nine different cases one listing! could understand &#8220;size&#8221; option different models phones, different cases misleading, probably saves boxwave money listing fees.as actual case&#8230; bought one &#8220;best cases&#8221; s4 per cnet. don&#8217;t know deal is, however case pure garbage! cutout bottom microphone off-center microphone actually covered! result, sounded muffled person end line. cutout camera way. normal pictures, ok case block lens, however partially cover flash. result, get glare bottom photo flash.the kickstand useless. nothing lock place, phone falls unless balance &#8220;just right.&#8221; even then, tap screen (ie: skip tube add), phone falls over. also hinge back phone causes phone lay flat.i paid $4 case, got type quality one would expect $4 case. would suggest case looking kickstand case. cases listing &#8220;might&#8221; better quality case, however, would hold breath. honest, cheap quality case received, deceptive nature listing, buy another boxwave case. 
 ordered cover protect new sgs4. covers phone, holes mics dont line centered holes buttons nearly impossible push (you really reef them). 
 don't buy cheap ugly product! worst mistake buying case phone. eew! never again! no! no! 
 bought two, sent three; took 4 weeks get mail, they'd warned purchasing; wrapped look like oem, i'm thinking it's fake; people selling certainly haven't responded complaints; works longer 4 6 year old oem batteries scavenged folks dead moto v3 razrs. wish could give stars one. 
 bought battery several years ago razr v3, battery shot it, shoulda saved money. worth time, effort money. wouldn't hold charge longer hour. probably relevant review today, still worth money 
 extremely disappointed product. isn't sellers fault, razor can't hold charge longer 35 minutes.i bought battery expectance maybe would better. totally wrong. thankfully bought new phone.don't waste you're time buying new battery,instead save buy new phone! trust did. 
 don't wast money battery china made won't hold charge. bougth 2 end throwing away. 
 3rd "oem" battery bought via amazon marketplace -- others, terrible. ordered form oem shop br50. sent br56 supposed even better 3 hours talk time. last 30 minutes complete overnight charge. nowhere long battery trying replace lasts hour instead original 2 1/2 hours.oem sent counterfeit fake battery --- oem. tell? motorola oem batteries made japan. say clearly made china. problem returned battery wireless phone accessories batteries4less.amazon_- screening sellers addressing issues. ton posts every single one motorola razr battery listing say got bad counterfeit batteries.theses companies make money selling junk, counting amazon customer feel worth hassle return it. every one return lose hour time. time worth th $10 get ripped for. anyway b/c hopefully point amazon going take responsibility conduct market sellers. amazon's new logo become customer centric company earth. well amazon, start here: bargain cell -- one worst offenders,wireless phone accessories nowthe oem shop -- joke name last one since clearly know selling counterfeit batteries.i paid $30 one batteries4less hoping get real deal -- got exact batter got oem shop -- exact counterfeit. nothing price paid. dishonest online sellers. 
 second one sent me, complete trash. 1 2 charge cycles dies within 5 minutes fully charged. buy 
 product (version 4.0) works v3 v3x. work new v3e.i using overpriced version 4.0 disc purchased directly motorola.software updates still recognized v3e. sure models listed work don't, fact non-supported models seem listed sufficient skeptical go elsewhere. yeah, it's penny, plus lot shipping!so, software works you, pretty nice. not, you're out. gave review one star based fact model know doesn't work supported list. 
 got two headsets high reviews.used headsets ps3, lot troubles getting work correctly sync console.the audio seems static mic doesnt transfer voice clearly.i bet better options. maybe arent real jabra headsets? 
 worst item i've ever purchased. brand new batteries wont' even fully charge phone once. don't buy it. regular stores stopped carrying keeps getting returned doesn't work worth darn. 
 wanted use rechargeables (good performance inexpensive) keep briefcase backup charger.that theory. use anything lithium (very expensive) alkaline (poor performance) positive contact touch. (i tried 6 different brands rechargeables)i ended taking apart (disassembly fairly easy) put solder blob positive terminal. makes contact nimh batteries battery cover thing really flimsy. add blinking blue light - certainly gets attention ends annoying. tried charge moto q car (while using bt headset) cover charger coat.i ended buying noname made china charger less half price, screw battery cover red led rather super bright blinking blue ones. course, accepted rechargables modifications.basically better designed products lot less. 
 best bluetooth headset i've owned terms comfort sound quality. microphone seemed fine.the ear pieces unfortunately attached head band via thin plastic. case, experienced structural failure 14 months light usage.if you're going spend $100 headphones, buy something stout particular model. 
 avoid avoid avoid. hold charge. useless piece junk. get something better made. pos. 
 first one got stopped working month later, motorola replaced supposedly newer one. new one continues work but- person side cannot hear correctly- lots static like noises even fully chargedfor excellent customer service, give 5 stars motorola 1 (or 0) star particular product.update: this, tried plantronics voyager 510 bt earpiece. also issues (while better motorola t305), gave bluetooth went wired in-ear sennheiser headphones 
 good long term. phone gets really warm charging. instead go original chargers. u spend 200-300 usd phone u afford original charger. stopped using couple times. 
 charger one cheapest, wasn't worth savings. less month product stopped working upon examination clearly fried! even outer plastic looked though melting. definitely worth it. 
 holster looks nice, seems well made strong clip it's tight put phone presses buttons way causing sorts unwanted things happen. put phone upside keep happening. way works fine. weird. 
 still waiting product since ordered january 1 2010 (3-5 days shipping) 
 poorly built phone holder. &#34;arm&#34; moves broken opened box due arm attached thinest piece plastic. slight torque arm could easily break off. 
 terrible quality, didn't fit vents securely. flopped around driving..tried take broke. waste money. 
 sticky dash mount broke tried remove it, one arms shortly afterwards. also, comes instructions, guess orientation pictures. 
 wasn't expecting much price least holds iphone, barely squeezes good amount force, slim skin cover. worth returning disappointing. 
 jeep liberty dont much dash board. (sticky past kept coming off) tried car vent stay comes handy. would recommend product. 
 kinda small phone advertisement said fit gs3 even took case still didn't fit one holders completely broke off! gs3 don't buy it's trash 
 terrible unit. magnet strong enough iphone 4s. ended buying differnt model 25 bucks connects cd player slot one amazing. 
 mobile service providers claim type antenna work, agree them. installing actually reduced reception 2 bars bars! search internet, find passive antennas like different battery compartment sticker claimed improve cell phone reception, block radio waves frying brain, etc. doesn't work it's waste money.i recommend buying wired antenna directly connects phone. phone doesn't connection, may want look different phone nothing without direct connection going work, may want look phone gets better reception (there -- read 3rd party reviews).i wouldn't recommend product anyone unless money burn. so, please send paypal account instead. 
 zero effect. windows must already allow enough signal make difference. bought back place get full bars right outside patio, almost none inside (i live concrete apartment). put phone place this, get good reception, didn't extend signal any, act repeater. didn't seem help car either, don't really need there. 
 nothing. noticeable change. used time. time anything it's phone. 
 spots around town calls get dropped use cellular phone driving car. areas small, 300 feet long. hold phone outside car drive areas, calls don't drop.i bought device hope would allow keep calls going without rolling windows. unfortunately, found absolutely difference calls dropped without device.when took device off, broke open took sides apart. didn't find evidence components inductively couple antenna interior components.however, installed, **look** impressive. so, want fake cellular antenna make car look "cool," fit bill perfectly. want performance improvement, consider one wilson cellular repeaters instead. 
 looks great fits dock fine pull sleve. phone loose one-two power bars on-two wifi rings. take they're back. 
 looked reviews, sure received something else what...this case looked cheap. broke side time...(haven't even 24 hrs).i sure photo one recv'd look anything like this. 
 guess get form trying cheap out. used piece connect regular headphones xbox 360, hold device place turn right order work. soon moved stopped working again. 
 careful know need. picture shows 4-conductor 2.5mm 3.5mm needed. however, specs say 3.5 2.5 sent. also, note 3-conductor stereo headsets. 4-conductor need using phone headset/microphone. 
 thought headset computer 3.5mm plug would able used plugging converter cable would fit att 2 line office phone. not. price low, would cost send back cost buy. bad purchase. 
 battery received new...i thought buying new battery instead received battery better condition one replacing. fair went back looked doesn't actually say "new" description, doesn't say "used" either. picture new battery describing "original" leads people believe receiving new, original oem replacement part. case. called customer service number answering machine asking name, order number, detailed description calling. somehow get feeling get lot calls complaining use screening method. seller shady allowed sell amazon. recommendation...do not, circumstances, buy anything seller! 
 purchased motorola s9 2 months ago, worked fine 1 month. buttons stopped working consistently, finally stopped working together. got agreement motorola replace headset warranty month ago, shipped back still headset. called got typical call center garbage, putting hold, disconnecting call, etc. finally got someone line claimed headset stock receive yet. never notified this, asked would stock told know, could call back week. told going ok, claimed resubmitted order would receive week. shall see...do buy headset, many people trouble buttons customer service terrible getting remedied. 
 o.k., o.k., know numerous reviews warn headphones fail sweat them, decided try anyways. want use workouts, ignore warnings - go buy something else.i received yesterday, paired blackberry, headed gym. worked great 30 minutes, left speaker controls left side (volume up, down, phone buttons) ceased work. definitely sweating, come don't even last 30 minutes??? sent back amazon morning. maybe i'll try jaybirds next- 
 pros: good pairing consistent stream. decent sound although loud enough.cons: uncomfortable fit(my ears hurt hour on), lots background noise, sound doesn't get loud enough pulic busy places, extremely annoying wear jacket since keep feeling catch.bottom line: don't buy it! participles good device need improve design make lot comfortable people start enjoy using it. 
 purchased trip hawaii could listen pandora phone hanging beach. absolutely work. tried phone fully charged phone battery still drained. worth purchase wish could get money back. oh well. 
 know it's $4.50, piece garbage outdated (made 2007) museum. first, comes tips. ordered it, thought would something base unit. haven't used refuse invest money this...it old probably won't work galaxy s3 does, would probably able power much.i bought desperation hurricane sandy hit. regret buying wasting money..... p u r e -- g r b g e! 
 cellet garbage. two brand cases broke soon buying them. claim leather really faux leather aka. plastic faux leather thickness dollar store condom. 
 get pay for. price seemed good true was. battery didn't last return immediately. 
 mounted anywhere near radio, often case, completely kill reception, fm am. even nothing plugged it. makes worthless me. avoid.they need better shield this! 
 unit puts much rf interference kills radio stations also kills fm traffic alerts garmin. unplugged radios return normal. may due car set up. 1998 honda accord. 1 12volt plug radio. may close. may better results. 
 buying headphones terrible mistake. sound flat lifeless volume controls nothing. bought use palm pre. don't know problem pre related, pre's bluetooth stack lot deficiencies, lousy headphones. either way combination pre headphones good one, palm pre owners avoid these. cheap pair wired headphones order magnitude better sound used pre. 
 found every piece igo inferior quality worth money. box toss wouldn't resell something worked poorly iffy best work. 
 finally gave products connectors always iffy. wouldn't recommend igo items. several box. won't even sell them. 
 headset purchased pair new storm, terrible, muffled called side sounded like tunnel caller side. tried several different phones, landline, cell area codes even international, result. pairing blackberry storm don't bother.i returned replaced blueant z9i amazing difference, clear bell ends call, great noise cancelling seems pair problems, also pair 5 devices switch called phone.hope helps someone. 
 worked fine stopped working. could hear ok person could hear faint voice. four months usage. won't buy another brand. 
 purchased product based cnet recommendation. cnet reliable source technology purchases. however, disappointment. unit eliminate sound effectively, volume controls "mushy," microphone/on switch stay retracted, resulting constantly discharging battery. pair easily, voice activated controls worked well. would purchase another, would advise others avoid model. 
 purchased reading positive reviews. paid attention negative reviews talked microphone wand acts on/off switch.i used total 6 times "wand" refuses go back. mechanism allows retract working result always on.when went amazon return it, would let return saying last date return passed vague language partial credit etc.so opened warranty ticket blueant. let's see works.i disappointed amazon clearly explain products go defective month. 
 good. cable super thin cheap. retracting mechanism broke like 3 pulls. 
 don't buy it. wearing one month already de area belt cracked. liked shape, model, s4 zerolemon super battery. said don't last use day. 
 bought case despite negative reviews due needing stuff asap sprint shipping new s4 dread everything need right away..i using case samsung s4 hyperion samsung galaxy s4 5200mah extended battery + black back cover (compatible samsung galaxy 4 models) [18 month warranty] **now nfc / google wallet** hyperion samsung galaxy s4 extended battery honeycomb matte tpu case / cover enlarged battery door. case performed great 2 weeks, glue stopped holding seams together stress points case. bought mine deci accessories. cannot recommend case. 
 stitching coming handful occasional uses. stitching bottom belt clip strap coming -- half now, uses past two months. otherwise model seemed perfect carrying motorola droid razor m. written positive review first week, review pulled. 
 someone, somewhere dark sense humor. ordering ca-100 cable waiting brown truck happiness arrive, discovered inside amazon box sealed package festooned nokia logo "ca-100" model designation. back package says "nokia original accessories" too. inside sealed box nokia branded ca-101d cable. means instead ca-100 cable usb connector one end, nokia 2mm connector other, ended cable micro-usb connector one end. so... joy. $6 cable i'm going burn gasoline time returning it. always use cable devices. however, cannot recommend vendor all. 
 i've tried several cell phone signal boosters, say, one worth dime. boost cell signal? maybe...a little....sort of... really. yes, bars sprint phone jump tad turn on, it's barely noticeable certainly worth exorbitant price. one feels like tech snake-oil. no, moving different locations made difference. nothing did. thing placebo. don't bother. 
 unit received contained instructions; problem go online company site get them. easy install put unit near window anywhere service (at least one bar) put antenna least ten feet away. antenna cable 20' difficult go unless going cable front you, next problem cell phone near unit 15' x 12' office could move unit antenna around could get green light also phone within 6' antenna. gave hour moving get green light moments back red. nothing improve signal since could get green light, presumably would indicated signal cell phone would pickup. may try four person sprint device company has? 
 ordered 3 them, 2 came without issue, 1 problem, got difficult get replaced, company ordered told go jabra directly, jabra website, entering info per requested, simply send email resolve trying notify via email (no phone #), i've asked exchange again, replied ask process again, it's never ending. bad customer service. 
 stylus used two days mesh surrounding tip began separating. point usable reliable. purchase item again. also bought trent limir dual purpose stylus working quite well. 
 one accurate. compared several high quality meters work, 4460 always off, often different direction different amount.i miss display amps older model had. useful determining circuit loads cases amp clamp convenient.it also hogs outlets standard duplex receptacle, one covered unusable. (yes, pigtail would help)i e mailed company twice inaccuracy inconsistency, receive reply.it became inaccurate finally died. 
 update: display failed completely product. buttons 'beep', readout blank. pos. back initial review.i placed 5000 btu ceramic heater device see actual usage. device showed around 11 amps constant pull, left plugged overnight heater ran. several hours later checked kill watt again, warm, receptacle deformed around plug, making impossible remove.this device supposed nema-rated outlet capable 15 draw. customers use kill-a-watt for, monitor real time use. clearly one could handle prolonged use, wonder sold gray-market product. 
 maybe bit harsh title, put something would grab attention. want save trouble none reviews myself. reviews great bought it. say sound pretty decent, similar slightly worse wep200. wep410 looks stylish, doesn't fit right ear. feels like going fall doesn't sit angle pointing ear cheek, wep200 does. sits angle noticeably flaring outwards. looks like sticking cheek 30-40 degree angle, looks extremely odd. tried three different sized earbuds, luck them. get fit ear, fit earbuds poor. even got father try headset see deformed ear canals, also didn't fit right. really wish could return this, since opened can't. sadly, give headset father. (he doesn't care poor fit long use hands free calling car)bottom line buy headset, buy samsung wep200. headset excellent price light weight headset also one want like ear buds like myself. don't like big bulky "android" looking blue tooth sets take bunch room. 
 paid $90 this. would stay ear. tried every ear adapter every way possible. fell ear every time. lucky happened car time, able find it. finally fell somewhere lost it. don't think got 4 days use it. want feel totally ripped off? get product, pay lot money watch disappear.it worse that. comes junk plastic case, useless storing charger stuff. pay much money something, provide nice case storing charger, manual, shorty cable. little box provide hold together. need new case right away. little bits pieces guaranteed scattered lost.also, first charger failed. discovered plugging computer using usb connection. jabra gave sorts headaches get new one. took several messages asked serial number. try find that? couldn't. exchanging several email stupid charger told remove rubber earpiece find serial number. couldn't read it--it small read.so want blow fuse anger. get this. aneurism, stroke, headache get treated like c$%p customer service. 
 ok, partner wanted jawbone advertising noise canceling ordered 2. arrived put charger. one jawbone broke even first use: battery fully charged half jawbone came charger tried disconnect - horrible charger connection. so, sent one back replacement. started using one that's left. jawbone connected ok motorola q phone rings headset not; press answer button - nothing; press answer button phone phone works like bt headset connected. tried 4 different phone result. so, next day sent second one replacement.a week later two new headsets arrived. charged them, connected phones ... malfunctioning again. one could hear caller caller hear anything. tried 4 phones - same. sent replacement. second jawbone loud statick cracking audio sent back next day.a week later two new headsets arrived. one would connect phone. second cracking noise. tried call aliph, manufacturer (no toll free number available support) 4 days, left numerous messages - one ever returned one call. sent numerous email messages - nothing back.so, would highly recommend stay away undeveloped product. idea great, need complete testing phase product still early testing. 
 jawbone bluetooth headset really made well lot worse people seem give credit for. parts fall short time cheaply made. looks metal really cheap bendy plastic material.further, set up, use one ear. headsets (like plantronics ones example) allow swivel earloop switch ears get tired using one ear. jawbone doesn't this.while jawbone's noise cancellation seem good that's going voice still sounds muffled, soft digital-like. further, jawbone big bulky comfortably put pocket take you.but main complaint aliph jawbone company customer service itself-they absolutely horrible. advertise website jawbone 1 year manufacture warranty end consumer. but, jawbone broke contacted getting warranty service it, rudely informed provide warranties units bought directly website. bought retailer, zero warranty! i'm sure whether even legal since i'm lawyer, believe reflects poorly company don't even stand behind products.i would never recommend buying headset made aliph. 
 box smells like cheap plastic burning electronics... i'm afraid plug thing iphone 4s... thing super cheap, thin metal alloy, poorly molded plastics, doesn't even ul certification...i'm guessing cost less 50 cents unit manufacture shows unfortunately... plus side box came looked nice 
 product looks solidly built. plastic feels velvety smooth. n85 doesn't charge that's nokia issue, usb device issue. ipod touch 2nd gen charges, tho. works.i thought going high vw jetta since sticks straight there's enough space stick whatever want charge.product works! mygearstore shipped quickly. fast prime 2 day fast enough.updated jan2012: 2 years, product stopped working. green light would flicker in/out. threw out. 
 stopped working. top works stoppes working every 10 seconds. makes phone go haywire. broke ford mustang's power slot prongs heavy duty large pulled slot out. buy. buy motorola micro use charger. good. 
 left eared. 90 degree turn fit ear bud turns wrogn way pops easily. sound form device decent, worth price hassel putting ear taking again. also earbud kept falling use. poor design. purchased many good reviews, i'm writting one.great sound keep ear keep falling apart you. total waste money. 
 like clean sleek look didn't last broke 4 weeks buy again... 
 wish give negative star!!! day came plugged car phone worked great min. unplugged threw glove box days go use - longer worked days sitting glove box. terrible. 
 charger worked great first, 5 months use died! light still comes won't charge anything. course return period ended 30 days, guess i'm luck. 
 used car. working, great. nice big blue light let know it's plugged in. chargers tiny lights visible one side. big transparent power indicator light seen sides.the design charger great. it's way fragile. plug issues 5 weeks got it, i'm looking another one (but obviously, motorola).i'm disappointed, thought motorola product would last longer. 
 charger worked well months stopped working. keep mind blue light distracting driving night. connected port back arm rest minimize light's distraction. 
 great price seems working lot people.but.. gps turned on, htc sensation samsung galaxy 4g either stayed current charge slowly gained little. stopped using weeks. look charger faster recharge rate (amps?) 
 nothing whether it's cheap knock off, primary beef charger, living couple years, bright blue light gives off. night it's hard ignore it, it's bright distracting driving. 
 original review "best mobile charger i've owned". even bought one girlfriend saw mine. now, less 3 months, failing. starts poor connection phone wiggle place certain position charge devolves able charge all. mine complete loss way out. one failed wouldn't give poor rating, failing together lets know inherent flaw design. i've disappointed excellent charger brief time worked. 
 product stopped working 4 months.amazon referred motorola 1 year manufacturer warranty.after calling motorola 6 different times (of course india call center) even emails (all responded to) told product stock tried send wall charger replacement . didn't understand product executing warranty car charger.still resolved. 
 doesn't work samsung s3... stops charging every seconds... try send back, words... still doesn't work 
 merchant claimed mailed item, never arrived. rather resending another, merchant finally agreed refund. good one stay away from, although finally refund money, guess gets couple points that. would think reputable merchant would suggested replacement option, none offered me. 
 worked awhile, maybe 3 months. stopped. kind review give something works well three months stops working? one star? 
 charger came bulk packaging. i've always leery chargers come way. it's big risk plugging s3 device could potentially knock off. here's beef, bulk packing stated anywhere description. gift? purchased charger directly amazon store there's really excuse this. 
 last long! sudden, stops charging. second one bought, thinking fluke first. recommended, unfortunately. 
 could give 0 stars would. item arrived plastic sandwich bag. charge phone. sent back. bought verizon charger works great. would recommend item. 
 ordered two first two work all, got two one spotty best got super hot plugged in. went verision store bought one actually works. 
 one died 3 weeks using new samsung nexus!!! wow, expected last longer... little upset... 
 four months trash, charge longer. contacted seller said, sorry 30 day window send back. ever hear 30 day warranty? garbage. guess get pay for. 
 ordered several time fate. micro usb plug end fails prematurely blue motorola light end adapter obnoxiously bright. bothered light adapter painted black, usb plug broke weeks later. i'm throwing away looking elsewhere. 
 excuse this. worked 9 months, like many things hassle replace less return. 
 cheap knock off. don't buy it. expecting one, like one came phone.the picture inaccurate. 
 product fit motorola phone. made flip phones. used newer style. 
 don't know i'm something wrong won't charge droid incredible. took five hour drive unplugged phone, battery completely discharged phone hot touch. 
 isnt micro usb chager regular usb charger send cheap adapter micro usb port falls really long waste money says nextel instead motorola dont buy! 
 worked great first- charged droid bionic quickly without issues. period time (6 months so) cord starts bending weird angle charge phone unless hold perfectly still (almost impossible moving car). 2 exact chargers suffered defect. would rather pay higher quality one replace every 6 months. 
 work new smartphones. smartphone said plugged doesnt work would slow charge. get modern smartphones. 
 stopped working exactly 9 months. bought good reviews. disappointed quality product. 
 charger work right package, gift. price great. found couldn't use it, took back try return. amazon said past return full refund.otherwise happy amazon. 
 found headset comfortable, excellent audio quality, times successfully connected nokia phones.after working blueant tech support trying two different phones, admitted known issue symbian os phones (most nokia smartphones) headset "paired" phone, connect reliably incoming outgoing calls. phrases used tech included:"[we] haven't got around compatibility issues symbian phones.""[this a] known issue."and apparently significant amount discussion blueant support boards (which could find call).not recommended symbian owners much would like to! 
 unit came right box rattling noise inside. would've kept bothering driving need turn head left right.also noticed didn't work pretty good paired two mobile phones simultaneously.it pretty small feels extremely comfortable, wish would've worked properly. 
 appears photo might sturdy items keep flash/thumb drives one handy place. nothing's truth. &#34;thread&#34; much thicker you'd use sew buttons ring led believe hold several items barely 1/3&#34; diameter. furthermore, actually put thumb drive ring, you'd need pair needle nose pliers spread ring apart, forcefully close back together. yes, cheap yes, several pack. $8.00 shipping (they come singapore), probably fashion better thumb drive holder using parts old key chains. far worst purchase i've ever experienced amazon...who ashamed selling trashy junk.the jokes me...i fell hype. don't let happen you. 
 first all, paid 78 cents 10 these. shipping all! would never trust hold weight cell phone. string thick fishing line. ring 1/4 inch diameter. loop big enough put three fingers thru them. bad investment 78 cents can't complain much. cannot recommend ever use them. far better lanyards much extra money. don't buy these!! 
 chose rating product never came. dislike help getting product. recommend one else buy person receive item. it's hard rate quality something exist. :( 
 hate fact wasted money product. 2 days 1 hour battery life. keep charger juice maybe 1 conversation, comfortable, flimsy. dont waste money. 
 read problem review bought thought fluke. mine little month plastic holds right speaker broke rendering headset useless. looks like return would replace another don't want keep replacing design flaw.sound quality great music. good want music headset answer phone call to. intend talking phone much back ground noise might one. 
 worth spending money guy ! worth spending time guy either !not worth spending money guy ! worth spending time guy either ! 
 iphone complete rip off, people know one don't even know got oter able say "hey got iphone". thing ipod touch basic phone functions.....more priced garbage crapple made rake apple fanboys money.....and fall it. 
 got sim card free promo item purchase cell phone, rates service really nuts, probably won't use it. 
 i've always bought international phone card i've traveled decided take phone one time try one sim cards. well, let tell you. made 45 minuets calls total 3 weeks overall bill $176. so, math, could spend $13 american dollars 10 euro calling card 400 minuets called hotel public phone....or $176 less hour calls. certainly worse choice made trip advise buy this! amazon.com, please consider taking list products...it misleading cost consumers way much money purchased. 
 read reviews carefully. ranking "high" may well-informed options -and comparatively inexpensive, easily available options!you'll need unlocked quad-band phone (available price ranges - sometimes buying one destination competitive price always) plus regular service sim, pre-authorized international use (call carrier go) use "just case" decide service use wherever you're headed. even dollar two per min "just case" call, service will, calls get local sim, cheaper. (or always text-message/sms, cheaper yet, even sim!) also pack good pre-paid international phone card, too, back-up (amt depending long you'll gone many countries you're jaunting - recharge this, too) call home something cell (which also get pricy).on arrival, purchase local-provider sim w/appropriate features (kiosks, local cell ph provider stores), add initial funds it. install ask so. buy pre-paid "recharge" cards needed; high-priced. found even e europe (every country) turkey - yes, higher per min contract, tiny percentage cost mobal cell ph! take minutes on-line explore regarding - glad did.i hope amazon withdraws offerings, truly do. 
 it's convenient, charges astronomical. even use handful minutes, you'd better purchasing prepaid card whatever country traveled to. warned, mobal ripoff. 
 chose card even though mediocre reviews one could find charged use, prepaid amount. went europe never used card/phone charged 3 text messages never got. $2.40 didn't fight error hard fact remains charged services rendered. further, $2.40 even got back 8 day trip. (emails got home already inbox) money, principle, don't like disingenuous companies. lousy $2.40 said sorry written off. would used card future trips trash now. 
 bought item forgot add unlocked phone purchase waste cannot use sim without giving credit card, means even want incoming calls still need register. plan pricing clear.also, phone number uk expecting us. 
 bought card took international trip. put card phoneand went site activate it, said put 19-20 numbers, therewere 30 numbers letters sim card. worthless. 
 charged battery use phone one hour. next morning wanted place call charge didn't hold. replaced older battery worked well. order oem again. 
 another plantronics blue tooth headset calls. works fine.i mainly ordered reading reviews iphone, - answer calls listen "acceptable" level bluetooth music.a) bluetooth music bad. sound tinnyb) use walking (not running, walking). music skips every step takec) stereo headset uses proprietary connector, can't use earphonesd) connector doubles earloop. although give earloops changing out, works mono earbud. use stereo headphone stuck single earloop.e) comes so-called usb charger, usb connector proprietary, non standard. means cannot use zillions standard usb cables/connectors you(i) lying aroundi would returned immediately, except "non-opened" items returned.choose product, one certainly work 
 worked great iphone3 nz-409 work iphone4... updates available useless...moving nz-500 unit built bluetooth iphone4 certification.... 
 know always risk buying generic, cheap, made china, stuff like this, ive actually pretty good luck cheap car charges like this. price, figured, id buy couple spares case one died.i ordered 3 retracting mechanism seems work well, two three simply work. tried two different cars two different phones. cases, red led lit up, cant fuse issue, neither phones indicated receiving charge chargers connected.the third one work, intermittently. connect it, leave cord fully retracted, charge. however, pull cord almost way, seems make connection charge phone.i know could probably return these, cheap are, worth hassle package pay return shipping. 
 purchased bunch since girlfriend tends destroy regular basis regardless build quality. bought similar chargers ok. ones however didn't work even right packaging stopped working uses. one left works half time. 
 micro usb side cable could never establish reliable connection device attached to, past week stopped working together. i've owned item well year; way soon cable stop working.i advise looking different company. 
 first off, rating 1-star can't leave 0. got phone iphone lack mms qwerty keypad iphone. boy, huge mistake. initially bought phone, week half major bugs started showing up. keypad text shows half time taking literally 10 minutes open programs. joke. then, started freezing badly way shut remove battery. time frame, downloaded anything could disrupted phone way. needless say, returned phone got replacement.the replacement phone great...for month half. that's issues first phone started happening again. phone, refrained downloading anything, period. say phone sucks big-time. 
 product merits 1-star due fact amazon censors well-cited reviews point deep flaws 'iphone killer'.it's nice faster cpu now, fancy qualcomm integration ati video hardware actually prevents video acceleration used, unlike predecessors, either nobody legally, capable (qualcomm), implement drivers, afford (htc). it's like getting nice, fast nvidia video card running computer safe mode.the phone actually take decent pictures, get pass sluggish, skippy, blurring display reminisces first gen digicams, well resolution reducing glare non-removable lens cover.heat issue device almost burn hand 3g wifi although it's nice display doesn't distort it, battery doesn't explode.windows mobile, os, isn't great still isn't great hardware. multitasks well end sluggish response running apps something background starts chugging cpu. graphics apis (such directx mobile) rely hardware acceleration, none phone, screen redraws sandwich making time, almost.think pda phone features, phone nice pim features. compared even palm's extremely outdated os, software os phone runs like sloth lacks polish apple ships phone.it nice phone allow flash new roms get past limited features ship (although video acceleration fixes), world traveler take phone use japan, europe, everywhere uses wcdma gsm, except t-mobile's/emobile's 1700mhz 3g network.unlike ace wireless gardena tell you, wcdma 3g allows voice data simultaneously. 
 actually never used why. finally got package folded half tire marks it. like mail man folded it, laid street, backed right top it, proceeded power brake burn top it. needless say screen unfixable creases barely still wrapper.it might good protector really probably absolutely nothing seller pretty steamed. 
 bought connect speakers tv. ok, guess $4.50 cannot expect much, dont expect last. cord really thin. make sure use minimum bending radiuses else feel like snap half.i also seem get 60hz hum leave extra cord laying around behind tv. associated power cords.first cord got sucked vacuum longer usable. ordered another metal connector broke off. looking different item time. 
 looked like great deal. boombox 1/8&#34; (3.5 mm) input external audio sources wanted use tablet computer couple portable devices. got distorted mono sound stereo sound 60 cycle hum depending far pushed plug. pushing way produced hum. tried number devices. results. guess internal wires connected right spots plugs. bought shorter, expensive cable works. buyer beware. 
 worked ok hour, starting making clicking noises cutting headphones. must shoddy product can't even work full day- returned them. 
 ear piece weak reception ,it don't filter sounds well,this poor product disappointed. 
 bluetooth woth buying. hurts ear bad take often. voice quality good person voice drops often. battery also bad. last long even full charge. never buy another motorola bluetooth again! 
 high hopes let hard. sounded like inside tin can. tried noise shield difference. caller end didn't notice effect removal background noise better favorite, plantronics voyager 510. big issue fit. ear loop slightly spring loaded keep mouthpiece sensor pressing cheek. intended allow sensor differentiate voice background sounds. problem spring tension ear loop slightly pushing headset ear. comes several ear bud sizes two ear loop sizes. tried all, ears. luck. held loosely slightest lean head side came. completely unacceptable far worse others i've tried. tested 8 different headsets. way tests pair two headsets, put one ear, switch call. even ignore fit problem (a deal breaker me) sound quality poor. worse caller bother, i'll stick 510. 
 lowest quality ever seen.i purchased cheapest got it. 
 bought bluetooth using another model plantronics bluetooth death. liked lot little bulky went slimmer model time; explorer 330. forget it! won't stay ear. makes ear sore hardly force wear (i job) get four feet away cell, get static. i'm disappointed model returning it. 
 cozip case simply case!!it protect iphones back thats it.cozip case protect phone breaking drops, schock all.its like case all.positive side makes iphone cooler stylish case protection,you extra careful phone,because drops! surely end expensive iphone.i recomend case style. 
 holy moly piece garbage! got cheapest/dumbest iphone case ever made! let begin:i iphone 4s 64 gig phone thing. wanted cheap black case it. wasn't concered protection whatever - something cover it. one looks good. look pics - looks nice, right? wrong!it's cheap piece bended metal/plastic. phone fits - kinda - sure doesn't feel secure! it's like rounded piece plastic - whereas phone, you'll observe - squared edges! part really bugged doesn't fit snug all: see main photo here? one see back phone? see apple symbol back phone lines nice flush back? lie! it's flush all! there's like huge gap back phone back case - feels terrible.most ports accessible thing - good luck using volume switches side iphone! can't. case rounded-edge thing going on, prevents fingertips getting side switches. dumb design!-seriously - know you're looking cheap case - ain't it! believe tell spend bucks get something you'll actually use enjoy. utter garbage! 
 really wanted work out! needed headset noise reduction could use car. callers can't understand i'm desk, car worse. made sure remove plastic covers upgraded firmware. many people praise audio quality, must lot variations units. know mine sucks. 
 tested unit 8 headsets worst sound quality, far. still can't beleive it! considering special features designed sound quality expecting best sound ever, oh well. way compared headsets pair two time, put one ear, switch call. allowed caller compare sound quality equally variety environments, ends call. tested headsets: jabra bt8040, jabra bt500, plantronics voyager 510, plantronics explorer 320, motorola hs850, motorola h700, jawbone, samsung wep200. problem sound quality caller bad could hardly understand word said. held unit inches front mouth could hear clearly ear. units tested go series background noise tests caller talking listening, case weren't able comunicate well enough get done. testing units went back tried one nothing seemed make difference. beautifull headset. looks great, feels great, great function fit, can't understand i'm saying there's point. man, i'm bummed! really liked one, too! 
 headset wasn't best quality - great me, talker, mic didn't work well. person end often hard time hearing talking quiet environment (forget car!). i'd recommend something else. 
 item gets dry-joint iphone side connection short weeks. you're stuck it. 
 ordered 2 item 2 theblack onesfrom 4 different sellers reading mixed reviews items. needed adapter pictured short plastic head male plug cord. none 4 received item pictured. reason needing iphone. fit inside tight spot back makita job site radio.without regular use ware tear, one sounded nearly identical tested music iphone 4s skullcandy in-ear headphones. audiophile, headphones inexpensive, adapters put stress yet.here's report adapter:white adapter received seller "cronuz" - 1 star:the cord feels flimsy. plastic used cord ends feels rubbery. experience iphone cases made similar material, suspect cord discolor and/or become dirty beyond cleaning doesn't break that.white adapter received seller "etech" (mailing label said "iflash inc") - 1 star:the item looks identical one cronuz. additional concern adapter can't get headphones plug without using lot force. force test sound quality, don't plan using cord again. also, 2 white adapters look identical, would think problem might encounter matter order from.black adapterreceived seller "eforcity" (not listing) - 3 stars:this adapter also flimsy cord. plastic male end slimmer fit tighter spot 2 white ones tested. hard plastic ends seem little durable ends white ones. believe get use one, wouldn't buy another one.black adapterreceived seller "elago design" (not listing) - 5 stars:first all, 5 stars based less $2. wouldn't say best adapter buy. however best one tested. cord stiffer feels solid others. female plug tighter fit play. plastic around male end slimmer rest. cord doesn't meet immediate needs longer plastic head, would buy use certain iphone cases block larger plugs.if order item don't receive pictured listed, contact seller. would rather give refund know shipping different brand listed. 
 shipping service terrible. don't expect receive order least 2 weeks. product feels cheaply made, like wire snap moment, all, work need 4 channels. 
 bought two help make keeping otter box case needed use speaker/aux cable.the first cable worked 1 hour began fray separate. second one gave audio one side. could pull cable slightly get channels (sides), gizmo (phone, tablet, mp3 player) moves slightest stops working sides.the bad thing static creates use (aux headphones).the item junk would avoid unless like throwing away money. 
 simply, product work. using makes sound muffled point it's almost inaudible. consider many reviews saying thing. heeded advice bought this. 
 things got bad reviews - ordered 3 sure got one good one (at least they're cheap). gave two stars instead one since, oddly, 2 3 worked intended purpose (a size adapter iphone), though none work plugged pc. hard imagine difficult product manufacture - assume manufacturer could simply care less...update: turns 2 star review way generous. 3 eventually stopped working properly. truly staggering level apathy manufacturer... 
 worked two months stopped working, well, works one side only, earphone get sound. 
 purchased item would work headphone plugged way...the sound muffled. worked fine headphone plugged 3/4 way. eforcity sent replacement charge unfortunately replacement doesn't work all. 
 give left right channels like should. music unbearable incorrect. buy this. 
 let use 2.5 mm headset. description represents accurately, time ordered it. 
 beware, get item pictured. get sort iphone recessed port adapter (kinda like belkin one) nearly good one picture.i gave mine away. hope prevents people getting ripped off.the seller even tried get recall negative comment promised refund. never received refund.tells kind seller you're dealing with. 
 purchased eforcity, us seller i've gotten items quality good price. case. item proper fit, fits bumper cases special cases would accept apple headphone jack (ie thin).but, first, getting audio one channel - jiggling bit cable base male end, 2nd channel started working getting static noise moving cable.audio would come go, briefly moving cable.filed claim damaged item. seems $1.70 drain. 
 looked like interesting relatively low-cost option wife's car/cell phone, since hasn't found bluetooth headset fits ear comfortably. unfortunately, cannot get unit pair three cell phones (iphone 3g, two new nokias). goes pairing mode advertised, none phones find (they find headsets computers tried pairing unit). makes rather useless, would strongly suggest testing phone one ordering.also disappointed lack usb ac charger. fault noticing comes car charger - convenient typically charge.no issues merchant - quickly shipped delivered fine. low rating speakerphone, merchant. 
 could barely heard using bluetooth device easy hear called. got progressively worse power level discharged. recommend product. garmin nuvi 660 better bluetooth audio quality. 
 bought use iphone 3gs. plugged in, got 'not iphone' charging message. sure enough, doesn't charge properly. problem that, even i've taken care make sure it's securely seated, won't consistently charge, there's telling certainty unplug phone morning, it'll charged.callpod charges old lg phone, husband's blackberry nintendo ds, flawlessly. adapter bust. haven't tried husband's ipod touch, can't say works device. 
 cheapest chargers ever purchased. work apple devices recognize authorized charger. pay get for. cheap price cheap quality. 
 bought set base lot reviews saying charge ipods. didn't realized kind ipod have, might 3g nano know won't work 4g nano. tried car charger, works play charge time. house charger doesn't. look label say compatible ipod 3g. however product description says compatible 3g, 4g nano, etc. bought enable charge without computer running. car charger important car long period time charging without playing. worth returning, postage cost items. 
 neither chargers worked ipods house -- ipod touch, iphone, ipod classics.it experience off-brand chargers sometimes actually charging even though charge light light sometimes item work wiggle connection throw salt shoulder attempting get work. nothing made work.i left item connected 8-24 hours, each, find ipods charged didn't. 
 bought "others" bought case purchased. one last minute "checkout" decisions. read reviews better. worked day received 4th gen ipod touch gives message charger isnt supported. reviews little scary. last thing want fry ipod. sure bother returning considering price. probably keep retractable cable toss chargers. 
 bought item.i receive 2 black 1 white.i buy supplier. 
 stopped working days. mishandling, rough use, stopped working, seems mfg defect. wont buy 
 within weeks plastic covering near plug ripped exposing wires two months stopped working. durable enough cell phone use. 
 piece never worked. headset works fine home phone wanted convert office. consistent pulsing hear every caller tells fading out. it's like bad corded bluetooth. 
 picture misleading - doesn't 3 stripes you'd need iphone - 2 stripes. doesn't work advertized. 
 maybe looked description wrong. doesnt work. perhaps dont realize many different types connectors size? problem seems stereo speakers wired together mono sound aren't?who knows i'm rewire it. bought simple ear piece/boom mic tried use droid. go me.your mileage may vary 
 tried use plantronics headset, mic wouldn't work. able hear side fine. don't order this, doesn't work advertised. one review mentioned worked perfectly purchased back 2008. person added onto review say changed something design problem adapter. heads buy disappointed. 
 bought charge old nokia phone couldn't find original charger came phone. charger worked fine first weeks decided stop working blue. idea happened wouldn't charge phone. throw saw point keeping something doesn't work. 
 complete cheaters. first all, charger never fit n73 phone slot. secondly, wrote 1st review criticisizing product, called saying send new replacement charger remove negative feedback amazon. waited almost 3 weeks charger never showed up. tried calling number got call, response.complete waste money, waste time useless product trash 10 minutes received it. 
 ordered oem blackberry headset months ago, & like one came storm, could tell difference & amazon seller bto inc.i placed another order wife headset, three weeks later & time offered amazon seller, "the oem shop" price. since stated oem item, placed order. received order, different first one ordered. original blackberry headset & first order, soft & flexible wire. one received "the oem shop" stiff & hard wire, flexible & feels going break folding it. think counterfeit blackberry oem one. never buy "the oem shop". worth send back. rating item:the original & one came "bto inc.", gets 5 stars.the one sold "the oem shop" gets 1 star. 
 adapters didn't last days daily use breaking. ironically failed strain relief male plug.when fail you'll see exposed wires male end break - way nice change adapters fail internally still look ok outside. 
 sure somebody screw simple audio cable extender cable, guys done it. impossible create solid connection inside iphone connecting headphone jack. everything snuggly plugged in, slightest rotation/jerk cable iphone produces hiss loss contact. goes headphone jack. it's like things made maintain continuous contact they're supposed contact. avoid costs. 
 sound one ear only. in-line remote controls don't work. mic functionality either. doesn't appear anything waste money.go radtech web site, you'll find similar product, except actually works properly. it's called procable shortz audio extender. unfortunately isn't sale amazon. 
 bought use p.o.s. credit card readers (most don't fit phone case on), made sure four-pole connector. although seller give full refund without question, cable didn't work cc readers have. 
 i'm sure long worked for...my girlfriend noticed pushed connection slightly, bass would suddenly get richer....tested nano iphone 4s. disappointing it's super-cheap cable so....i missed amazon claim window 2 weeks eforcity covers 30 days. companies would send replacement, questions asked, company not. buyer beware.note: connector fit iphone even case on, purchased begin with. 
 sent back immediately. one channels didn't work consistently, side also held microphone, didn't work either. worthless.five stars amazon return process, though--simple, easy, quick. 
 exactly looking - exactly looking - 
 bought one, broke 1st use. sent new one free one broke 2 days.. suction cup one device problem... think. idk would spend extra 10 get better one amazon drop 40 go apple store buy there.do buy 
 put window popped times think new stiff. wanted put kitchen washing dishes cleaning general answer phone hear music.. little nervous first fine.up date pops never got use couple times hr so, dont waste money time 
 case looked great snapped tight. minute snapped on, realized, needed remove microsd card phone, copy files put back. nearly impossible remove card centro without removing battery cover first (what clever engineer palm thought would good idea?!?!? definitely usability expert). so... hmmm.... yeah... eventually couple days later fearless friend mine pried open extremely sharp almost surgical quality blade. break it, said case survive open regular basis. - great case never need open battery cover. need open - look different case. 
 basically cheap plastic case.. want cheap... go it. case always unsnaps randomly good reason. somehow put right amount get unsnap. however, still easily unsnap case i'm glad phone hasn't fallen yet. swivel clip also hard press take phone... going fingers pushing ends clip order get phone clip. annoying trying answer call trying get text message. pro product it's cheap. 
 read reviews, would bought 
 item recommended piggyback purchase purchased plantronics voyager pro+ bluetooth headset. advertised desktop charging stand headset. apparently, it's base voyager 510 charger (the old, first voyager plantronics introduced, owned light-years ago technology time). pro+ fits awkwardly (tight fit) base come charger (although picture shows cord attached it). it's desktop weight voyager pro+'s charger fit. jam there, base sit flat rolls around desk. stand vertically. sum, it's rather expensive paperweight advertises plantronics. thanks nothing hope helps save money. 
 product bad joke! isn't charging stand all! simply plastic disc "supposed" fit hold earpiece. can't make function described mechanical engineer! come instructions all. arrived simple clear plastic bad nothing else. rate total waste money! 
 caution: get entire product usable device likely deal two, maybe more, separate vendors, shipments, multiple shipping charges, hard find specs tip fits exactly devices. one cares enough really help out. returns part(s) likely, add cost wait fully functional product. product, amazon sub-vendor system creates mess.i would avoid product like poison! 
 broke within minutes attaching phone clipping wat waistband. waste money. 
 ask money express shipping takes longer regular mail. took almost two weeks receive item. wrote seller seller never contacted me. 
 phone basic, little thin calculator. manual spanish menu options phone too. couldn't distinguish lower uppercase general dirt-cheap phone. would never recommend anyone. 
 mine lasted 4 days screen quit. reason sold warranty! wasted $40 one. 
 battery never worked. would hold charge. left plugged night battery never charged up. 
 really wanted work never charged phone 2 minutes. don't buy it. 
 used once. doesnt see charger unless push hard - do, use different charger, never charges. landfill. 
 bought hoping many stellar reviews would trump many poor reviews, unfortunately turned case me.i ordered item able charge new at&t; inspire 4g, htc. it's battery hog, portable recharge would great.i opened box, really excited product sexi look at... it's one dark black boxy electronics usually associate type product. it's curvy nice looking.initial read instructions proved challenge, it's clearly manual written chinese translated converted english north american sale. bit contradictory vague couple aspects, went online watched how-to, could say certainty using properly.i charged initially 24 hours (it recommends 4-6 hours), instruction manual came said one light flash completed charging. 24 hours, two lights still charging. went onto website states charging complete, light remain solid. however case me.i decided based specs, 24 hours enough charge (by technological spec 5 hours complete drain full charge take). plugged device, immediately 4 lights lit battery pack indicating full capacity. 5 minutes, dropped 3, 10 minutes went 2...at point contacted manufacturer. quick respond it's likely defective. questioned see lot said yes. asked don't resolve said (in broken english) people expect half price competition. seems bit odd response them. i'd want put best (usable) product price, put product, hey, whatever.bottom line: amazon issuing refund i'm sending one back. normally i'd give benefit doubt re-order another one, given less impressive response manufacturer, i'm planning returning refund. i'm going order zagg sparq 2.0, gets great reviews. almost 2x price, i'll suck pay it, suppose want product comes warranty support, that's cost it. also learned amazon doesn't lot flexibility marketplace seller practices, said hands tied. i'll stick ordering direct amazon going forward. :-( 
 unpacked plugged charger. second, third fourth led's lit up. seemed charging ok, external led laser light worked fine.after 30 seconds, led's went out, power button nothing matter many time long pressed, unit totally dead.back goes. glad spent extra $4 would time weekend trip. 
 gt product free, basically purchased larger charger received guy free gift. well, it's junk. device doesn't charge. plugged charge lights come seconds indicating charging unit shuts down. like many posters, mine probably defective. anyhow, advice avoid. 
 charger simply best. use iphone 5 works flawlessly. i'm getting almost 3 charges itorch needs recharged. never worry stranded dead phone. don't hesitate buy one!update 4/7/13 - unfortunately, spoke soon. enthusiasm purchased second charger shortly thereafter unit doa (would turn full charge). since still faith new trent, ordered third charger one also doa. 1 3 chargers performed expected. disappointed. 
 product works advertised, charging iphone full times one charge. really gives peace mind toward end day.update february 2014: broke 5 months use. 
 couple months use, battery wont charge waste money . . think waste money buy charger last 3months . 
 really loved first got it. charged well battery lasted long time. went charge second time would charge. know mine defective return mine. 
 product arrived read instructions charged battery recommended time. product work, charge. charged again, andthen issue. offered refund replacement. product book suspect. advised may go multiple purchases shippings order receive functional device. 
 would bother model. tried day two sounded like muffled waffles much syrup poured them!bluetooth connected disconnected randomly. sound solid, tinny.get sound matters speakers reviewed today want good solid pair speakers work last long time.sorry altec, blew one! 
 oh fits iphone mophie plus case -- perfectly! barely 2 weeks....the clip already torn case, nearly lost iphone 4s mophie air case, barely hanging threads. could give negative stars lack security case offered, would.so....not good investment....find something else!what else say....? 
 plastic clip first one broke day 2. figured manufacturer's defect, contacted seller quickly shipped replacement - questions asked. interestingly replacement metal belt clip. lasted month finally tearing poorly secured flimsy "leather" phone pouch.don't waste money. good products fit large phone (iphone4 mophie juice.) 
 looks like top button exposed pics. case ruin iphone. 2/4 iphone 4s top botton stopped working press hard. 
 well, get pay for, sometimes. wanted believe adapter going solve headphone jack problems, alas, ten minutes workout fallen completely apart wires detached. 
 first wouldnt even charge motorola cliq xt couldbe phone. wouldn't even turn one week. 
 work ipod touch 4g, dont know cause broken already box, leds dont work this?! garbage, dont buy guys 
 doesn't charge aa batteries case, actually drains battery device connected it. actually, fair, charges device 10 minutes, flow seems reverse, exhausts battery device it's supposed charging. threw recycling bin. 
 bought eneloop aa rechargable batterys..i began charge/play video mp3 player..within 5 10 mins picked charger..the charger stove hot, smelling melting..to think leave room while....scary situation..why make things thin plastic material?dangerous...... 
 researching ways boost cell signals found this. reading many reviews realized issue weak cell signals fixed, easily permanently, cell phone use wifi make receive calls text data. weak cell signal common problem concrete metal buildings shielding signals out. many live areas cell signals weak. always access wifi home office. republic wireless solved problem two years ago. uses voip calling backed sprint cell verizon roaming. also works world wide wifi $5 month. service unlimited contract. unlimited call text plan $10 month, unlimited cell, text data $25 month. use phone (moto x $299 moto g $149) need republic's proprietary software work rates. using 18 months worked perfectly. 
 work boost cell signal basement. exchange large office omni directional antenna. expected, amazon wonderful exchanging better model shipped right away. returns exchanges easy amazon never fear oredering always make right. 
 return meet application. home 3 stories, boost cell phone range well. 
 buy item really expecting first figure nearest cell phone tower house exactly direction? really planning climbing roof erect pole thing point directly cell phone tower? no, like you're thinking stick window increase reception. well won't. suggestion don't buy it; end returning way did. 
 give one pass. worked week two, suction cup quit sticking. poorly designed cup tension mechanism, holder came apart own. 
 two stickers, one protective screen one backing. stickers used separate protective screen backing. unfortunately sticker attached actual screen would peel off. leaves screen protector unusable. three screen protectors problem. 
 cool, searched screen protector especifically blackberry 8350i arrives, doesn't fit blackberry!!!!! pissed off, either sent wrong product advertised wrong. either way, didn't take action product cheap would cost price return it's much hasle.i still put screen even though doesn't fit (too big) amazingly still didn't fall looks transparent it's protecting. fit phone would've best product ever quality thing good.seller, you're reading this, deserve real 8350i blackberry curve screen protector.thanks. 
 protecting screen bb curve past 3 yrs. custom cut long universal plastic screen protector. change, order product dismayed it. good side a.) tiny cleaning cloth; b.) 100% exactly size bb screen. bad side are: 1.) can't re-applied mess-up; 2.) one 2 tabs said "please peel mask application" harder remove. paste dried signifying old stock.it faster satisfying cut old way. odered 5 pieces (5x3 =15)and would take awhile finish off. wasted 2 already initial application. first trash-out cause would stick re-alignment. second, used wet napkin remove dried paste leave scratches new screen protector dried paste can't removed all. attempt remove dried paste, bigger area spreads sticky mess.it's worth returning throw away go back old way it. 
 good. used handful times *light* duty charging phone. using 5 times, received red fault light. plugged couple times cigarette lighter see problem resolves, blew fuse car. buy brand again.company would stand behind product - told contact amazon, b/c 30 days, i'm luck. 
 recently received battery, immediately noticed suspiciously looked "used" (it deep marks scratched ends) doubts ... but, wanted give benefit doubt went ahead charged use.it appears new battery holds charge "stand only" (with calling all) four days (and good 3g area) ... new battery supposed last "up to" 10 days stand only. battery received better old worn battery trying replace. would advertise "new" battery obviously used? fact, old battery looks newer one.maybe order ... but, seemingly false advertising, cannot recommend. 
 bought 5 cables 3gs reading many reviews none working. say accessory supported everytime plug in. useless 
 original usb charging cable two years never problem. recently wanted extra cable bought one. less three months started show problems... charging constantly interrupted move cable bit would start charging again. today working cable completely ripped apart.it may cheap definitely worth last 3 months. better go apple store buy original one. 
 cable doesn't work, sure got bad cable something soon put nothing happen won't work wall pc, good thing cheap would really piss. 
 dont trust it, failed week like every knockoff purchased. get good brand name tape something never lose. 
 every time plug called "product" iphone 4, says "impossible charge device". something like that. reason buying it?! another disappointment... 
 whenever plugged iphone 4s cable would charge disconnect within seconds finally stopped working together. another iphone accessory wasted money on. makes sense buy accessories apple. it's money, it's worth it, least they'll work. 
 order 20, 30 pin apple cables none work devices, computers power supplies. good price, well good product worked, probably less return postage. 
 got pack 5 cables knowing original apple cables original replacements. knowing know issues come cables, disconnect pulling cable instead connector tend fall apart problem allways remove connector pulling cable, however cheaply made even care stop working. 3 5 cables dead now, havent used 2 one falling apart joint dock connector due natural twist cable. two even get recognized device longer even though cable looks perfect shape. wiggle cable eventually connect moment touch device drop connection. 
 save money. two things shorted out, fortunately devices weren't garaged. cables cheap rubbish, really! 
 fit iphone 4. cheaply poorly constructed. really duped sale recommend others buying item except directly apple. 
 weak poorly made. would better spent little money purchased expensive cable would worth time money so. 
 purchased four stop working spit end cord,one plug apart 
 bought 2 stopped working within month. didn't spend lot money obviously something wrong them. 
 unplugged first time came apart. paid cheap got cheap. even worth time comment 
 bought two within month head come loose wire cover exposing wires. basically fell apart stopped working. went monoprice got iphone cables cheap high quality. 
 got pay for. got inexpensive wires fin work ipad 2. use devices work purchased for. 
 bought ccceaccessories 1 penny. guess get pay for. fell apart one week minimal use. bought 3rd spare cable fiancee, broke quickly. 
 skeptical read great reviews. works charge sync. take good care cords anticipate issues.april 2014. ordered another one doesn't work all. 
 particular brand didn't last month. try find another brand. good though. 
 read update!as always, apple cord shorted need another. great, cheap, working replacement charger!update: literally hours later cord won't sync computer. charges. can't get around all. also, cord hard get port port. cheaply made. save money buy cable! 
 materials design nearly durable ones come phone. delicate easily broken. ordered 2 1 didn't work all. 
 bought 20 these, figuring lasted couple months each, i'd years worth cables. ones i've used barely made week. one car lasted two uses... one gave away lasted less couple hours... understand cords provided different companies, may better others. company bought ships hong kong. emailed issue heard anything back them. clearly waste money time. i'm &lt;$20, i'll consider cheap reminder get pay for. two apple cords still kicking years use, whatever cost, assume it's worth extra amount. 
 matter cpu usb 2.0, 3.0, even usb plug adapter item still non functional tries connect hear & see signs never makes it. went microcenter purchase one there.after taking apart modifying wiring got work using lower gauge high quality copper wires. 
 item looks virtually identical original apple cable, iphone 3gs tells "charging supported accessory". don't know phone tell difference, likes charged original. able use retractable type cable months quit working. price, can't complain. 
 cord least 1 long, 12&#34;. even good price doesnt save bad product. call company -it's &#34;oh we're sorry - it's stock - thats sent short ones.&#34; 
 buy this. apple certified. pay get real cord. dad burnt drive iphone using non apple certified cords, don't risk it. 
 better buying true product apple store stead... total waste money. won't connect many things stuff connect won't keep charge going long. awful! 
 things terrible! least ones got "itemsforless". cord pulled phone end.come amazon get "sellers" web site! it's getting bad e-bay. 
 waited almost 2 months product finally got it, didn't even work. worst dollar ever spent. :( 
 price great reviews mixed. took chance ordered two cables. ends connect iphone completely alignment cables! contacted seller thought try get work. possible way going take chance damaging iphone. seller sent two cables better. contacted seller refund wanted return cables. makes sense spend amount refund shipping defective cables back seller! warned -- buy! product waste time money. 
 yes, cheap, thought hell ill buy it. cord worked week randomly stopped able charge phone lol dont waste ur money, takes like month shipping 
 never buy another cord sellers...they break don't work start. claim apple certified none are! 
 cord took almost month get finally get it, work!! guess get pay 
 made mistake purchasing charger cord.as soon connected iphone 4 charger, started overheat within 5 minutes, charger cable burning hot.the bottom line price chargers ring alarm bells! learned lesson.stay away buy genuine apple charger instead!the adapter, however, charge iphone4. receive &#34;charging supported accessory&#34; connecting. 
 got ipad cable didn't receive one! totally forgot one. knew something missing didn't realize remember got email. 
 rarely used begin with, won't even charge work all. it's frustrating. 
 purchased 6 extra chargers car, office home. within 1 week none would work. quit first time tried using them. poor quality waste money time.. better charger. tried contacting seller reply!!!!! 
 don't mind buying non-apple parts, advertised apple oem parts, turn cheap chinese knock-offs, disappointed. bought 3, even uniform. even usb logo opposite side one plug. grind nail file make fit bumper iphone 4. ok price, giving one star selling counterfeit instead simply saying 3rd party cables. 
 i'm sure it's apple actual chord eventually chord stops charging idevices, iv'e noticed ipad ipod. it's says "this device supported"it took month fir message occur devices i'm sure it's waste money. 
 okay changed comment this. thought dad said worked, didnt charge dads phone. really disaponted :/ 
 first time got it, working. company nice sent another. however new one broken well fell apart within seconds. 
 first all, shipping took long, forgot ordered them. looked good first, kind got excited extra two cables didn't remember ordering. plugged first one iphone 4, connection snug. problem right? sync finished, went unplug, except wouldn't unplug. used pressure, cable disintegrated, situation raw wires coming (see one pictures description). worried getting electrocuted not, eventually got connector phone using pliers.second cable, thing. cable snug, cheap.these cables absolutely worthless. 
 fine one week stopped working completely. bought twp thinking would work perfect long time, useless. 
 stopped working 2 weeks, tells compatible phone. worked 1 week. 
 bought two usb cables. thought i'd give whirl. took receive them, turns neither work...don't waste time money.

 item ordered boho tronics ($2.75). apple product knockoff possibly reject. took almost 3 weeks come. doesn't work. won't sync charge ipod touch. reordered pricemasters ($3.19). reordering realized may also turn knockoff reject. i'll wait see. possibly vendor first (different name) vendors use knockoff supplier. it's inconceivable real apple cable ($19.00) could sold $2.75.amazon allow device described "by apple" it's apple.--------------------------------------this follow above.the order pricemasters ($3.19) arrived today. one doesn't even fit ipod touch. won't force fear damaging unit.save money try one griffin ($14.15)[...]at least return amazon refund.or still betterspend full $19.00 go directly apple. 
 used one week (if that) thought great, charge apple products. garbage. 
 piece junk waste time money. sure got away selling garbage! 
 worked times charge iphone. stopped working would charge phone. 
 cable's external insulation separated connectors, sides cable (phone-end mac-end), within one week. left internal wires exposed. junk, junk, cheap junk. 
 received cable when/how described. but, pluged cable computer charge phone, unpluged it. usb portion cable, stayed computer!never again! 
 charger worked perfectly fine 3 days, certain position. two weeks, stopped working. buy waste money 
 day got using charge grandsons ipad fell part end plugs ipad came apart buy anymore sealer cheap made worth money waste sorry. 
 cable work, however material made poor quality. end connects phone rips easily.and also, end connects phone little thicker apple cable. wiggle cable it's plugged doesn't slide well apple cable. you're better spending little buying genuine apple cable. last lot longer.. 
 don't buy it. cord longer apple one, seller lies say's is, syncing problems. 
 iphone cable needed replaced wires exposed. noticed starting come apart days ago decided order one. relieved received today cable really thrown replaced. i'm afraid fire something. plugged in, disappointed find didn't charge phone. tried different outlet tried usb port laptop. nothing worked. sending back amazon find one store continue charging phone. 
 great charger first day broke next day sucked really needed charger one broke !

 every iphone connector seems break wires comeout within month two i'll buy another one like $5 less, suck. 
 purchased cable nathan norris. please, please please save money buy cable. mine stopped working little month. unfortunately, i'm outside timeframe returns i'm stuck usb cable that's completely useless.save money, don't buy! 
 beware buy from, many vendors there, seem version another.i ordered one vendors vendor actually sent older style, release clasps (for old ipod classics video), it'll work, however, ordered, another thing learned studying connector:it's shoddy quality... center ground blades apple's proprietary-side, coming apart, point?look, probably spent $300+ ipod touch iphone, cheap-out shoddy cable possibility ruining connector?connector 101 - takes two connectors mate, one destroy mate. i've decided fork dough apple get genuine one, least that's made tolerance good.buying various sellers random crap-shoot, cheaping buying knock-offs chance destroying little mobile investment...i would stay far away these. i've learned lesson, luckily, vendor gave full refund ($1.50 woohoo!), said, vendor probably knows his/her products questionable best... 
 first cable seem work well short period time quit working... taking apart see why. solder connections horrible... really surprised poor connection. like cheap cost charge bit cables right. 
 inexpensive barely work. attracted price tough make function kids phones. 
 work first 30 days,i brought two, one broken, line disconnect 20daysthe one works ok first couple times,after 30 days still looks prefect, suddenly plug pc, nothing shows up, became working1 dollar 20 days, depends u thinki never buy it, cause might work suddenly u really need charge ur iphonethos previous reviewfvery nice price, works well.i buy two got it. usb good also fast shiping

 worked 3 days never worked again. disappointed product. would recommend anyone all. 
 always proponent bluetooth headset use, especially talking cellphone driving time. think unfortunate certain people consider using bluetooth uncool somehow associated rather hateful stereotypical image hummer-driving yuppie. you're driving talking, get bluetooth headset! would rather see people driving around road like telephone tech supports blind distracted zombies. ends rant believe everyone using wireless headset. let's talk plantronics discovery 925 bluetooth.i've gone bluetooth headsets past years - mostly motorola jarba models priced around 20 bucks. absolutely complaints regarding economy models. received 150 dollars headset(!) mail, seriously expecting awed shocked level performance, feature, luxury previous unexperienced.the unboxing setup process pretty straight forward. one fancy feature indeed useful leather carrying pouch included, isn't plain leather pouch either. carrying pouch, fact, built-in battery. headset stored inside pouch, plug charging cable charge headset charging pouch. later on, you're road, fact two batteries ready used greatly extends hours use charging. unfortunately, charging carrying case positive thing say headset.according manual packaging, headset supposed fancy audio-processing logic make phone conversation crystal clear. alas, case. got headset bonded verizon krzr phone made test call wife, voice sounded rather dull, down-sampled, somewhat metallic. unacceptable 150 bt headset! honestly say, term voice clarity, previous 20-buck motorola/jarba outperformed ridiculously overpriced headset far. tried headset cell phones. motorola krzr rather common handset, plantronics 925 gave quite let-down.in conclusion, recommend headset anyone current price. around $30 - $40 (currently amazon already offering 50% original listing price), looks/design important voice clarity, perhaps recommend you.sorry plantronics, honestly, genuinely wanted love headset. time being, i'm going back 20 dollar jarba. 
 really don't clue say comes three different sized ear buds. buds close size could barely tell difference. tried three them, single one small enough ear none would actually considered "in-ear" ear bud me. also simple chore swap out. also learned lesson (which suspected anyway) cannot use headset doesn't something goes ear help hold head. case actually pretty stupendous, though. would love headsets came case like one. 
 one worst bluetooths i've had. thought i'd try price saying goes, &#34;you get pay for&#34;. 
 bluetooth four days. worked perfect, paired easily, sounded great.then sudden, stopped working. wouldn't recharge, wouldn't turn on...it nothing. 
 first read reviews m1100 925 plantronics. believe 5 star reviews fake. amazon. see 5 bad reviews bad device coming amazon.. bought m1100 first full static conversation. sent back day bought it.. amazon gave gift card refund. ordered 925. one worst m1100. bluetooth hold static without phone. got like five minutes ago. also sending one back..... everyone grown going want do. im saying dont dumb waste lot time..... reviews fake... ordered m1100 925 plantronics.. love static ear two you.... 
 plugged computer, whole computer turned off. powered on, received message bios: "usb device current status detected" shutdown 15 seconds. i'm running self-built computer 900w power supply, 1 usb device connected.out curiosity, tried another usb port (on back) - result. also, result toshiba laptop. also tried usb wall charger have, produced electric arc. obviously, doesn't work. i'm glad didn't damage hardware.see find better quality product - one junk. 
 battery arrived within time frame shipping well packaged.the first visible difference original cell one made china; original made korea.the original solid, one seam around bottom, one could see battery's contents starting leak already. manufacture code dc061128 (november 28, 2006) means battery 5 years old.the battery come full charge, battery that's already leaking isn't going used phone. since cost nominal, it's worth bothering return it.rating: 
 headset cancel outside sound. also isn't loud broke broke couple days got it. cheaply made! 
 update: reviews state - thing snap 2 normal use. don't buy this! sounds great, break normal use short while. samsung's "warranty" doesn't cover obviously defective design - well, someone sue language written warranty covers defects surely defect see many people problem!since samsung won't stand behind - i'm boycotting samsung products - go!and, here's "repair" them:gorilla glue: really good gluea piece flexible metal - looked around parts box found sort bracket - strip thing metal, cut bit big. bent cover top bottom band gorilla-glued it. 24hrs, put black duct tape around repair job it's lasted several months. actually cut small part broken band near snapped thin face wanted slightly tighter/snugger fit - that's i've got now.the headphones still uncomfortable wear hour others said dig ears, like gym around home bluetooth headset voice calls phone. can't wear hour time.[final?] update - sep 2010: keep breaking new places. sixth break headband today, i've given trying repair it. so, found pair headphones longer use (traditional over-the-head band), took earpieces off. used gorilla glue blue samsung earpieces on. now, fit comfort issues gone - won't break either. but, cable 2 earpieces isn't long enough - so, right put behind head... thinking cutting wire 2, splicing/sodering piece cable go around band over-the-head - altho require skill wires inside cable thin. 
 units - 2 them- would sync work laptops. returned via amazon printed ups label 7 weeks ago. still wating refund. amazon says cant refund charge, merchant.guess, file dispute amx. 
 dont buy it. waste money. back cover kept coming out. know sent back never got money back. waste time money. 
 nice looking phone.if phone problems, motorola agents unavailable help way except offer maybe repair sent in, cost unlocked version.find company supports products, either number one, wants be. want android, several companies hungry biz. motorola not. 
 recieved time back cover broken asked another one sent pink cover seriously wth hone self stop working within weeks horrible dont wwaste money time ith people unprofessional. 
 mom missed razr phone got her. but, got excited opening realized cheaply put together felt brittle hands. don't recommend unless like crappy cheap phone backup. 
 going return phone stay charged hour, that's problem far unable use extended time see issues. 
 i've used many igo products first one disappoint. doesn't fit 12v outlet (cigarette lighter) well comes loose time. devices run charge think they've charging.so product fails it's one purpose: charge stuff.i still love igo products i'm still happy igo 12v chargers own--just one. 
 check reviews amazon.com, hundreds. one them, despite traumatic experiences few, ever received one star.that's changing today.i received stylus stoked try sketchbook mobile. soon turned iphone though, "what heck; let's try menu screen navigate app." pushed stylus gently, nothing work. pushed little harder, seemed get iphone working. opened sketchbook, nothing happened. pressed harder, still nothing. pushed even harder tried draw, stupid stylus scratched screen. it's little nick screen protector, i'm worried.i read push harder get working screen protector, pushed way result shown.i'm returning stylus a.s.a.p. amazon.com.my guess one-star review--ever. read others precautionary reviews, thought exception.i wrong. 
 stylus cheap quality press harder screen use iphone ipod. get pay.don't waste time money. 
 supposed work phone, doesn't. purchase product lg gu295 slider phone. may cheap uses micro usb wont work phone. 
 buy. threw away. overheats plugged point hard touch it. 
 loved everthing headset stopped working less 3 weeks received it. disappointed threw away box nothing. worked, fantastic stylish. disappointed. 
 headset purchased wife. biggest problem months, wouldn't hold charge. tried everything get work right, avail. finally gave & disposed it. 
 i've purchesed s9 volume cellular received item promissed. days usage, device started problems controlls. within week, device dead! contacted seller, advised situation, seller helpful providing assistance, options including refund. even encountered problem returning device ups, seller promply refunded money upon receival. stated earlyer, greater service, bad product motorola!! maybe bad luck device. well buy seller, another s9 head set. 
 looking discrete bt earphone worked ok. important thing portability discrete - look like nerd streets.my objective listen podcasts... worried sound quality.well, thing needed work right blue-tooth transmission.... doesn't !! works inside home inside car. i'm street doesn't work anymore (i live big city lots radio interference). bring phone really close earphone order bt work without interruption.when say doesn't work = music plays 2 seconds pauses 2 seconds, plays bit pauses bit more... it's bad connection noise. stops transmitting altogether.the funny thing phone conversations, work anywhere. i'm listening music podcast, doesn't. think stereo mode takes bandwidth requires better transmission rate.... possible interference... whatever reason - it's worthless, unless interference-free zone.ahhh.. fitting. good. big head, even me, earphone loose fitting. need press ears hands snug-fitting easier hear.do waste money !!i used htc tytn ii phone windows mobile 6.0 try product. 
 awful product! first received it, skip/back function work, could skip tracks headset advertised. volume low, even maximum device headseat volume levels. headset exposed even little moisture, either: randomly increased decreased volume (with insane "beep" every 1/2 second) stopped functioning altogether. made headphones useless jogging/workouts yard work - even little bit sweat screwed up. rubber ear pieces fell third use. finally, range horrible - unit cut constantly cell phone holster waist. wear arm holster unit would range. compare 2 foot range 40+ foot range another bluetooth device, headphones don't measure up. suppose would suitable sleeping phone next bedstand (and sweat sleep!)... thank goodness $50 instead $100 asking retail stores. 
 bought use jogging works half time. difficult use consistently definitely regret buying since i'd rather paid something dependable. 
 would purchase product internet. ordered one, recieved it, wouldn't even register charging, didn't get test it. called amazon, great. representative kind quickly sent replacement item overnight. opened one charge. trouble pairing phone, eventually that. tried use it. put "on" position, turned off. put "off" position, turned on. even took brick mortar store make sure wasn't missing something. purchase one store, h710, next model up, say like it. works great comfortable ear. also seems bit quality discrepency two virtually identical items.the one purchased store lot less "plasticky" one ordered on-line. seems less-than-coincidental recieved two row malfunctioning significantly. 
 charger charge rapidly, it's normal charger. also bulky top charger, bulkiest i've seen years, it's hard fit things outlet power strip next it. self favor skip 
 honestly didnt notice phone charging faster....seems like jus regular phone charger...says motorolla dont know, could fakey rip off...its workin like regular charger, impressed 
 product work box. plugged phone tablet. go. avoid. 
 ordered item already 5 motorola mini-usb micro-usb working well earlier order another company. one arrived noticed two phones (a droid global 2 lg) would work (i ordered 5 these). adapters molded plastic id skn6252a. ones work look little better built 97 mm versus ones don't work 85 mm. hologram trademark, suspect ones work counterfeit. least cheap. 
 motorola thought would really good, didn't last two weeks connection started going bad. wiggle micro usb end keep charging light phone. mini usb cords/chargers don't problem them, it's port phone. 
 don't waste money work u get them, quickly break and/or mess phone u try use it's plugged in. doesn't work u try use computer transfer data like photos, etc. i'm disappointed b/c purchased 4 since went cell phones micro usb charger mini usb chargers & seemed like waste throw old cords away. knew taking risk looking reviews, decided chance & struck out. advice even gamble working. 
 reviews, seemed little adapter magic. however, tried multiple mini cables chargers none would allow charge mifi novatel. 
 bought several stopped working within 2 weeks receiving them. would returned them, time would gone post office, paid postage, waited come back, wasn't worth time money. don't buy. 
 fit materials ok, holes cut poorly look like someone pocket knife, strip silicone one seam, like mold wasn't properly formed. result appearance product embarrassingly bad. save money, go one better made...perhaps made rim. 
 bought product knowing reviews gentle it, problem even though red light lights up, never worked. cheep. worth returning 
 i've wilson fan since days manufacturing hf yagis love wilson sleek. decided upgrade gain antenna increasing signal strength. however, antenna shows zero improvement little zero db gain spike comes sleek. guess rg174 higher loss thicker cable comes spike antenna counteracts gain antenna. 
 seller neglected state antenna doesn't work alone. idea needed buy separate receiver work. sold together. 
 purchased blueant z9i headset based rave reviews submitted reviewers. unfortunately, personal experience blueant nothing short total disappointment.first off, little history. years, used old logitech bulky trusty "logitech mobile freedom". trust me, besides bulkiness fit, great battery life decent reception sound quality. better wind resistant most. favorite plantronics voyager 510. far, itis best sounding trustworthy bluetooth headset. still using today. like look fit works fine. gripe easily picked ambient noise wind noise noisy environment kill performance. quest ultimate bluetooth headset, purchased plantronic voyager 815 disappointment.i also used bluetooth headsets various brands nokia motorola.when read rave review blueant noise cancellation technology, jumped opportunity. boy, disappointed receiving parties kept telling lot noise (regardless adjusting position) background voice sounded tinny. volume headset also low side.since then, moved jawbone ii jawbone prime. 
 product 9 months. matter fact 2. sound clarity fine even walking around noisy areas. problem ear piece. one ear piece post broken second one rubber gel earpiece started separating post. blue ant wants charge $20 two replacement ear gels. ludicrous new blue tooth $60.update: i've return order. realize best choice. blue ant sent retail package. pieces padded envelope. fine initially since refurb. although, someone pack wrong charger package. return dept. stated sent pieces back upc code retail packaging....huh? don't think guys know doing.i need find better product. 
 got 4 sale, shortly state mandated handheld phones car. chose brand based solid year's use another blueant bluetooth speaker bought another person gift.right away, one speakers wasn't ever working properly. weeks later, mine stopped working. 2 probably aren't getting used, wife doesn't use phone lot mom probably let battery die. won't get feedback those.they paired right away worked (mostly) line. since 2 4 bought either failed stay paired paired simply quality connection can't recommend product hesitate recommend brand. 
 got really like it, load iphone phone book support blue ant sucks. want send testing instead new one. don't buy it! 
 get pay for. purchased friend lost friend. realized i'm type person buys cheap crap hoping perform. thing never held charge. connected plug, sure, worked nicely enough. what's point wired bluetooth?? 
 us android tablets. wish noticed got , sent back obviously.i would think would want ti make tablets capacitive screens, 
 i've stylus month worked well first now. tip dirty looking takes pressure get respond also leaves many smears screen fingers do. i'm sure tip cleaned. would avoid stylus unless want one disposable. 
 first, unit operating normally, lowest volume setting loud factor 2 good you're hard hearing. you're not, headset probably damage hearing longer notice.secondly, unit spontaneously stops working. becomes necessary disconnect battery twice. tried replacing battery that's problem. result accessing battery many times cheap plastic cover eventually loosen refuse stay attached unit. 
 second unit crooked band around neck fit ear well. use late return defective product came like that. 
 rated charger two stars takes long second battery charge. two external chargers plugged spare batteries captivate battery charged much faster infuse battery (they completely new & needing full charge). works however taking 7hrs fully charge spare batteries. ok 4 days charger work. blinks like charging extra battery place phone charged all. disappointing dropping 1 star star possible! 
 iphone 3g user. love iphone. cheap motorola h375 bt earpiece worked fine except wasn't comfortable ear fell easily. sounded good though.i used blue ant speakerphone. great! great battery life worked perfectly right day "buzzed" died. got lot usage left favorable opinion company even though went kaboom one day.i self professed gadget freak. ok, said it.when saw blueant v1 bluetooth headset read it's features knew me. initially expensive saw amazon $79 figured couldn't go wrong.rofl!okay, always try give new gadgets fair trial recommending friends clients giving it. using blueant v1 bluetooth headset exclusively since december 2009.it simply frustrating bluetooth earpiece ever used! 3 weeks turned voice prompts & speech recognition. announces callerid incoming calls it's seems take forever finish wants say answer phone.if earbud isn't perfectly aligned ear tick people call answer can't hear anything saying. especially prevalent car. (2003 ford expedition eb, somewhat quite car)it really trouble coordinating things iphone 3g. calling out, problem, uses earpiece fine. go answer call... much, selects iphone manually select blueant v1 bluetooth headset iphone menu. okay get bunch replies, yes try "this that". didn't work properly consistent inbound calls.okay, this, still continued try blueant v1 bluetooth headset given it.perhaps put bookshelf marvel technology allows functionality small form factor. guess i'd amazed actually worked.pros:comfortable stays put ear.volume level decentgoog-411 built hard coded speech recognitioncons:it sucks.poor audio fidelitynot iphone friendlyit sucks.battery life good.really bright blinking on. (this deactivated likes come back on)it sucks.in case wasn't clear, would recommend product anyone.i hope find review useful read reviews purchase products, like new bluetooth headset going buy now. let research begin!~e 
 i've unit three days. product suffers glaring problems:1. painful wear. earpiece cover made hard rubber. foam. soft rubber. using smallest three covers ear bruised. could wear plantronics bluetooth hours; one agony minutes.2. on/off button located underneath flexible skin unit. hair-trigger. disconnected numerous calls trying adjust jawbone's position volume touching outer skin unit way hangs call.3. sound quality horrible. fair marketing hook unit microphone technology. saved research money speaker. sound tinny garbled.keep looking: unit answer. 
 jawbone may perform admirably far technology. generally don't care much, sports car, trying avoid loud environments i'm conference call.my issues unit simply doesn't work well. i've tried different tips, including available free additional tips none stay ear. jam thing slowly works way course couple minutes. since button external body unit, try press back end hanging call. great idea button anything. similarly try turn thing on, hold "button" you'll find thumb covers little red/green light tells whether not. stupid. 
 don't buy it!! ear hooks seemed break month wearing... wait came w/ 3 4 additional....but wait buy wait would want thing would shut w/out waring unable saty connected phone!!!! wow god thing amazon reasonable price get hosed price retail store!!! buy plantronics m50 - bluetooth headset!! look amazon it!!!!l.s.thomaswest chester,pa. 
 aliph jawbone ii farce. tested calling several people nobody hear well. said sounded far away, even though volume it's maximum. fit comfortable all. tried every single earbud earloop. vas button can't make contact face, unit useless. press face (face skinny?), point wearing headset need use one hand operate hand steering wheel? safe imho. 
 really wanted like headset. purchased it, thought small, unobtrusive, blinky-blinky lights, subtle professional. blogs yammering "military-grade noise assasin" technology made think couldn't go wrong.wrong.after purchasing it, couldn't get stay ear, tried many (i got bored dozen) iterations ear in-ear adjustments. willing tolerate falling ear time, served primary function.but didn't.people kept saying couldn't hear me, background noise intolerable (so much noise assassin). also, whenever tried pressing jawbone ear could hear better, pushed disconnect button ended call.ooops.and paid early adopter price at&t; store; nearly $150 shipping.my bad.don't repeat error. good product. 
 bought aliph jawbone ii bluetooth headset noiseasssassin black hated work like suppose to. 
 jawbone ii bluetooth headset really made well lot worse people seem give credit for. parts fall short time cheaply made.further, set up, use one ear. headsets (like plantronics ones example) allow swivel earloop switch ears get tired using one ear. jawbone doesn't this. order switch ears, remove earloop reinstall it.while jawbone's noise cancellation seem good that's going voice still sounds muffled, soft digital-like.but main complaint aliph jawbone company customer service itself-they absolutely horrible. advertise website jawbone 1 year manufacture warranty end consumer. but, jawbone broke contacted getting warranty service it, rudely informed provide warranties units bought directly website. bought retailer, zero warranty! i'm sure whether even legal, believe reflects poorly company don't even stand behind products.i would never recommend buying headset made aliph.a much better choice would theblueant z9i bluetooth headset (black)because:-it doesn't require unit touching jaw bone cheek all-it's lot easier put take off-it's comfortable doesn't fall easily-it' two selectable levels noise cancellation-it's firmware update-able-it wind noise suppression-it's cheaper yet audio quality callers same. noise cancellation equal-it full 2 year warranty 
 purchased product work noisy environment, thought would trick. worked fine far noise reduction, fails design.i problems getting used fact didn't need raise voice heard phone. i'm shout someone 5 feet away, speak normally phone. hard get used to, working it!this device though, extremely painful wear length time. part behind earpiece, rides cartilage ear nice sharp, pointy corners get painful couple minutes. tried combinations earpiece & hangar without success. would tried jabra ear gels others recommended except one issue.i use headset occasional device, seems designed worn times. want device turn want on, own. power button extremely easy depress turn on. carry pouch belt, pressure pouch turning it. try answer incoming call, find gone device instead phone.in summary fits good, you're going wear time, great device, especially noisy environment. 
 2 first generation - wonderful. new jb comfortable. clarity lacking noise reduction seen good. callers end always complaining poor quality. total reset several times due total deterioration sound. 
 horrible device - purchased 3 various sources - one amazon - guess 2 three broken - one joint behind holder - one devices jaws came open driving dropping expensive device.just poor buying using experience. 
 i'm honest people... complete utter junk! things never purchased this. rush jumped bad item. phone different give tip: get something mount dashboard double side white foam tape. however, don't install middle dash. possible fix drivers left side corner dash. line sight distractions.as thing... shakes, rattles, makes kinds noise weight smart phone much it. 
 thought $8 good deal, uber-cheap! spring-loaded vent clips attach top unit, thicker vents jeep cause pop occasionally. also, bottom mount doesn't attach all, every time hit bump car, phone mount flop around...poor design, need vent mount look elsewhere! 
 design okay, whole thing made really cheap plastic.the ball joint mechanism really hard move adjust.the ball joint plastic cylindrical protusion attaches holder. part broke, weak thin. gonna make important joint thin, should've made metal, cheap plastic. 
 guess crap shoot buy cheap, since lot reviews positive decided give try. unfortunately the&#34;spring loaded locking mechanism&#34; work one, making effectively useless 
 purchased case bbuy almost year. cheap, thin leather peeled way sharp jagged plastic case. recommend case also start loosen time. use dlo case it's reliable.i also high quality screen protector, imho, important protection put iphone. whatever case end getting, get high quality screen protector...as far case goes, i'm looking replace something lean still put phone dlo...as see, like layers protection beloved iphone! 
 used long 20+ hour flight (multiple connecting flights) recharged phone fine first flight. could recharge partially second (connecting) flight. recharged overnight hotel first destination going long bus ride, wouldn't fully charge phone enroute second destination. that's experience thing since then.the 5200 mah overrated. maybe like 3000 mah new, much less it's used couple times.this experience 2011. it's stored drawer year, found cleaning finally decided review it.junk, stay away. 
 mine looked good new seemed complete, seals package broken received it. pretty obviously something returned that's big deal (if underwear something might concerned). anyway, arrived nearly fully charged (four five lights) plugged usb port laptop. plugged output satechi nook color lo behold, nook proprietary cable lit started charging away. turned video let play satechi charged nook charge increasing consistently whole time.then disconnect satechi laptop longer powered. oops. less five seconds nook cable's charging light turned off. pressed status button satechi (which supposed briefly light indicators see much juice left) nothing...no lights all. nook started discharging normally.i plugged satechi back laptop status lights lit back up, well nook cable's charging light. bottom line: satechi obviously charged, wouldn't send charge nook unless satechi powered. kind defeats purpose. hadn't gotten appeared used goods would returned another - sounds like great thing - decided bothering returned it. 
 *** important: battery properly charges laptop usb port. attempt use car charger, wall charger, etc. unless confirm puts 500 ma, more. see [update] section below, details. ***[capacity summary: able (carefully!) charge droid x **which extended internal battery 20% capacity** 1.3 times. product worked advertised, able charge least 2.3 times, assuming li-ion phone battery poor end charging-efficiency spectrum. would expect least 2.7 charges droid x regular (non-extended) internal battery.]overall design nice; looks nice, shape good, attractive. but... several problems.first, battery supposed 'new' condition, clearly (and heavily) pre-used; box stains, sticky stuff, extra circular stickers (from previous 'owner' broke seal).second, didn't work. phone (droid x genuine motorola extended battery bh6x, holds 1800 mah instead usual 1500) could charge total 1.3 times, external battery totally drained. surprised, repeated test, got results. super careful: let external battery charge 36 hours; waited til phone 30%; charged 100% (cell on; gps/wireless off; tasks killed; screen off/no activity). disconnected external battery right away, phone reached 100%.i repeated process; plugged phone external battery 30%. two hours later, 70%, external battery 100% drained.very disappointing performance. able transfer 45% alleged energy droid x (1800 x 1.3 = 2340 mah, 5200), wikipedia says li ion able charge 80-90% efficiency -- something clearly wrong here.i would stay away; worried bought it, noticing many recent reviews (as april 2011) complained same. think they're selling bunch returned units. really irks me, i'm extremely busy, really don't time kind stuff; want buy product works lasts, i'm happy pay whatever takes.[update]satechi contacted me. claim smart phone chargers provide many amps, fries external battery. recommend *only* charging laptop (where usb limited 0.5a), whereas used (in two tests) chargers 850 1000 amps.however, excuse; design defect. able charge source, long least 500 ma. every electronics device planet circuitry limit amperage takes needs, gracefully rejects excess current. tried hard phone convince design defect; found disingenuous. review remains 1 star... sorry, satechi.[/end update] 
 connects quick phone, calls dropped. makes weird high pitch squeel charges. charger mini usb means use proprietary one (negative imo). got $-3 rebate. i'm happy getting paid $3 buy headset. good shipping.update: didn't get rebate $23 pretty bad bluetooth. one works currently. callers complain lots noise end. controls pretty bad cannot use voice commands htc incredible. 
 junk. never one sound bad. doesn't even hold charge long 
 ordered zagg screen guard,i figured really good becuase there'svideos people bragging it.well really dissapointed. why?because it's nothing piece rubber.it doesn't look normal phone. fingers didn'tglide accross screen. left much aresidue streaked.look, stick regular hard screen protectors.there way dependable less expensive comes 1. 
 instead giving guys long review product, going give summary product. btw, rookie term installing screen protectors, used work cell phone company, installed countless screen protectors customers.pro:nonecon:will distorte screen image, unclear (made cheap vinyl) super sticky, it's almost impossible remove without pulling screen phone literelly. leaves residues phone remove it, it's nightmare remove residues screen, even trick using piece tape remove residues. exchange phone removing screen protector touch sensore started acting me. asking refund, maybe even damage phone.if care expensive phone, please, please buy product, give nightmares handle! 
 ibought invisible shield back iphone 3g. studied installation videos instructions. invisible shield impossible apply properly. sticks peeling backing. edges apply properly around corners iphone 3g. part film apply back iphone looks nasty. least zagg accepted return credited charge money-back guarantee. 
 bought product seemed like excellent alternative case. product difficult install cover corners phone. ended throwing out, waste money difficult worth frustrated phone bubbles it. 
 acquired headset whensocom: confrontationwas first released thought getting deal getting game headset $60. couldn't wrong.as headsets go, worn lot them. i've owned old-fashioned wired headsets, pre-bluetooth wireless communicated little receiver clipped belt plugged phone, course... plenty bluetooth sets.let start saying need headset playstation3. theory, bluetooth headset work ps3. (granted won't bluetooth inherently buggy technology.) likewise, headset work almost bluetooth phone. however, personal preference separate headsets don't like pairing unpairing time.having said that, let's talk headset. basic basic gets. need basic, power you, you'll find similar quality less money sets. try thejabra bt4010, writing sells half price sony. heck, even find $10 bluetooth headsets really want go cheap!apart poor value, sony set awkward fit. thin rubber ring around little plastic "barrel" supposed stay fastened ear. sets either "form-fitted" rubber piece simply stay ear altogether. design gets uncomfortable quickly a) part goes ear may right size ear b) over-the-ear loop made cheap plastic opposed rubber rubber coating like many sets.the battery life decent, nothing write home about. charging stand? it's cheap, lightweight plastic falls easily. usb cable little bit stiff, natural tendency curl may well topple stand.as sound quality... yeah, basic again. sure, works, basic. felt like didn't good range volume. many times cranked max still could barely hear.since games usually $60 headset came bundled inside $60 game, tried hard find reason keep it, wasn't "free"? end, could find redeeming qualities returned rather allowing take space drawer somewhere.if you'd like good places start search another headset, few:personally, can't get thejabra freespeak bt250v. it's comfortable don't even notice it's also vibrating/call notification feature, absolutely great leaving phone charger keeping headset home office. writing, sony ~$45 jabra ~$60. may find jabra cheaper even $60 it's definitely better value sony!if you're looking really great sounding bluetooth set (i.e. listening music), i've really happy themotorola ht820. two speakers wraps around back head/neck. fair warning, though- motorola sounds awesome speakers huge wearing set makes look like total dork.there hundreds, maybe even thousands bluetooth headsets matter one finally choose, please don't make sony piece junk. dollars go farther something quality/lower price, price/higher quality. 
 unnecessary equipment ipod touch 2g, unless fingers gigantic. maybe might need this. gave mine away. 
 bought whole collection various styluses ipod touch. i've used handspring palm pdas 10 years (visor, m515, zire 71, tungsten tx) don't like using chubby fingers input touch. rubber-tipped styluses foam-tipped cousins don't job. iphone/touch screen surface designed work stylus. finding place keep stylus also problem. pda, slot it. ipod touch, slot, stylus pocket, touch. tried using styluses days, gave went back pudgy fingers. could write five times faster using graffiti, palm died alas, palm longer sells anything phones. 
 you're looking something make using touch screen easier use....save money. product work well all. push hard screen (which can't good screen) pain it's worth. 
 thing won't slide screen all. it's though actually designed grip screen like race car tire. absolutely worthless handwriting almost impossible use drawing. tap it.it's even worth $1. spend $10 real stylus actually slides screen minimal friction. 
 bought item iphone arrived suprise, work iphone. also made low quatity. great price worked. 
 got last night really excited first reading great reviews others. however, realized it's what's hyped be. memory didn't come phone go buy one separately last night map features doesn't even load prompts many questions crashes. furthermore, open battery case disconnect order phone work again! gps doesn't work either since old at&t; service don't data plan. thought gps feature like get buying gps separately doesn't require internet service satellite only. short-cut email feature doesn't work either! tried many ways get right keeps prompting messages again. log web site feature log yahoo get email way, what's short-cut feature doesn't work? also, difficult time find delete email account created one??!! number buttons really small want dial number really look right button push. features icons really small well many really understand one which. guess i'm used iphone's bigger icons user friendliness nokia big disappointment. wouldn't complaining much e71 hadn't $300 dollars. around $200 would give average rating instead one star. $300 much better. fact, iphone couple hundred worth it. didn't like battery life iphone gave e71 try. close, mention camera/flash seems work fine battery life e71 seems awesome long lasting fully charge it. may get cheaper version nokia since can't use email, map gps features phone. beware complaints order phone $300.edit:someone responded review saying since didn't data plan couldn't download maps emails. that's true logged wi-fi still didn't work, whereas iphone didn't issues. 
 bought nokia e71 straight talk service. thought best phone world, started givi g problems 1 1/2 weeks later. took back, got another one, within 3 weeks gave problems. could return itto phone company. boy return 6 times. getting new phone back time. last time 1 month ago, sent refurb phone, well 3 weeks ago. phone wont turn on, couldnt find memory card, gets hot, freezes time, reset it, lose main app" ovi store" send itback again. im upset nokia.this worse nokia phone ever had. ashame too, becausethis phone all. could work. looked nokia forum everybody complaining issues. everybody, model, similar models too. nokia please fix it. bacause right bottom. im really find another service provider due this. anybody know phone company unlimited everything low price makes good phones, let know. 
 bought phone amazon.com. at&t phone logo phone. truly unlocked phone. sim restriction removed. able make receive phone calls sim cards. able send receive txt, mms, email, use data, gps, internet, wifi becomes unusable. return item. buy featureless, sim unrestricted phone $15-$20 amazon.com online auction sites. disappointed. 
 used scroll lists, try type stylus', won't work. 
 don't waste money. first can't keep track it. second, dragges across screen end tool wide. keep clean?? lost again.... 
 luck this. order lost friendly customer service people sent replacement immediately upon notification...and added second free one...so complaints there. one fell apart couple days neither worked well. 
 doesn't work otterbox defender case! never tried without, 1 star know give. 
 impressed seller's delivery. item arrived month early. however product problems. ends splitter cable loose connected headphones stay well own. one ends splitter cable work. would ship back demand replacement, cost ship back hong kong way $1.10 paid it. overall, recommend anyone ordering seller again. 
 unfortunately one side splitter doesn't work. don't recommend it, since takes work ship back throw buy another one. 
 bought split audio computer two sources, seems simple enough noticed right channel working, unplugged splitter find tip plug (approx. first 1/8&#34;) broken inside computer audio port. ruin plug can't plug jacks computer audio outlet port broken piece stuck there. computer permanently crippled limited one channel due poorly made product. remember get pay for! 
 point case protect phone. case well. using couple weeks worked fine. didn't like could dock case nit picky.one day sitting curb waiting taxi take football game phone slid lap. fell total 6-12 inches max. landed bottom corner case split open. either side fell phone landed front glass cracking screen! much reading found screens pretty durable assume fluke must hit small pebble right. either way case would done job right fell phone would cracked.luckily phone works fine large crack annoyance weak spot any. thanks apple at&t; fix costs ~$200 happening. ended getting griffin easy dock case works great much sturdy design. 
 agree positive points reviewers said. could ideal case, 2 weeks clips hold two halfs together started breaking. kept together electricians tape broke off. bargain cell great immediately sent replacement 2 days already one cip broke. unfortunately without clips thing doesn't work. i'd gladly pay dollar clips work properly, i've ordered silicone case. 
 holster big iphone (3g) snug fit. found another holster smaller liked better. 
 warning: want save time, money, iphone, never consider crappy item.the holster one metal clip center two loop straps hold pants belt. imitation leather skin actually thin cloth sandwiching cardboard paper.in less 3 days purchase, one loop straps tore stitches case body.another 2 weeks passed found metal clip missing holster barely hanging remaining loop strap. lucky found iphone would fall onto concrete floor.nothing say. 
 crap. case small fit iphone vibrant. case sent looks nothing like ordered. small snap loops instead permanent ones like picture. cheap would cost return worth. 
 get pay for.... pay cheap cheap.... leather texture sort flimsy (not mention) thin covering peeled simply trying put belt. basic pouch, flap, magnet design. add insult injury magnet isnt even strong one. dont know many times phone fell case actions simple getting truck bump seat. 
 get thin case work case. belt loops broke 3 months use. got grantwood iphone holster instead. 
 case fit blackberry storm, although seller claims does.the case small storm silicone skin big naked storm (the phone bangs side side). 
 either poor decription, confusing pictures amazon, ordered case iphone 4. much short. looking various views, less 3 different items shown. hope get money back, mostly shipping. cannot comment quality case fit. 
 easy follow instructions may actually work phone would pair connect mac laptop bought for. disappointed amazon nowhere first 2 pages mention piece junk bluetooth technology item. 4 pages there;s mention reviews labelled motorola bluetooth speaker. also fine print box statement might buy bluetooth adapter pc assume mac also. waste time also expect hit return postage item designed purpose purchased 
 bought broke. don't even know wasted time, wasn't even long cord... purchase phone!b00dv2oqfythe product way better actually correct length & durability. 
 bought case wanted purchase sturdy reliable case iphones 3gs. case terrible. lets dust dirt scratch back phone time 2 parts allow case fit together always come apart. plastic case made also brittle. eventually begins chip away time thus leaving areas phone exposed. it's terrible case waste money! 
 bought cover phone att store. liked design cover virtually lip cover screen. however, really disappointed cover. here's main problems it:1. doesn't fit screen protecter well. one corner screen protecter keeps coming up.2. it's leaving marks phone. took cover day saw rubbed red coloring onto phone. luckily wiped don't like fact rubbing phone.3. biggest problem case. doesn't stay on!! case lock together constantly coming apart. find put phone pocket pull back end pulling case phone. good case constantly coming off!i like case would suggest anyone buy it! would suggest finding one either slips phone (like gel type covers) one truly snaps around phone. 
 bought 2 - 1 broke putting phone. stay together. look elsewhere case. 
 two things make recommend buying case:1. bump back apparently supposed hold two halves together: ends tilting phone backwards slightly whenever put down, makes much harder see screen. (it also doesn't hold two halves together).2. every time attach headphones, case slides reattach it. beyond annoying.another note: case listed separately color, bad review going show pink unless copy colors. difference various colors, one review would apply all. 
 green color really cute. bought replace pink one bought at&t store much money. however, green case broke exact places indicated users' photos. within couple weeks getting it. heck? thank goodness amazon amazing return policy. disappointed pink ifrogz case withstood lot abuse toddler. 
 one positive thing say despite expectations, thin piece plastic front bottom piece hasn't snapped...yet. got case freebie bought iphone. wife liked color it. course next two weeks nearly dropped phone several times bottom piece slid taking pocket. simply won't stay on. it's snug phone either. gaps top bottom plug headphones docking cable slides case. simply poor design. got free want money back. 
 made mistake purchasing one at&t store ridiculous price compared amazon. perhaps $10 worth having, cases already worn away color around edges screen playing games using phone. haven't much longer month wear started show quickly. instead looking like cool metallic case, looks like cheap plastic case painted cool metallic color. good quality. 
 2 days normal use, blue paint begins peel off! silver-metal material showing. looks ugly! would never buy again. 
 iphone 3gs outerbox protective case. armband case small fit outerbox case don't want take outerbox case every time want use armband. waste money. 
 idea purchasing product would fit arm anyone 400 pounds. band made fitted anyone smaller. 
 guess get pay for... plastic work well touch screen.. really sucks... tried cutting out... afraid iphone might come out.... so, i'm back holding running... 
 say? clips keep tight broke maybe one week use.it cheap product even worth value paid for...unfortunately, worth shipment price either.do waste money junk! 
 screen protector shield included case cover fit iphone 3g. align "home" button, screen protector shield long bottom covers chrome trim. align bottom screen, covers part "home" button.there also weird cutout upper left align cutout case cover.additionally, screen protector shield scratches easily.if you're purchasing case cover, factor cost purchasing separate screen protector cost included screen protector shield useless.also, purchase one merchants listed besides pc micro store. pc micro store's shipping slow. took week receive live city them. 
 earlobe turn red wearing 1 hour. pads protect earlobes. every time turn head, wire stick skin pull ear pieces. sound system cut out. push ear pieces together hands time want sound clearer. idiot design ? 
 worth money spent, worked well quality design durability. asked refund could 30 days. 
 told excellent product someone owns it, tried it. trying two bluetooth headsets this, wanted one people could finally hear without background noise. it. everyone trouble hearing it, saying static scratchy. think time bite bullet get jawbone. 
 product showed looked used. box properly, missing manual box ratty. seem new all. 
 large ear piece fit ear. uncomfortable. ear piece broken upon receipt. charger standard. recommend keep looking. 
 got september 2012, background noise always horrible, became really bad phone close bluetooth device. device right ear phone left pocket noise unbearable. three months use thing dies minute connected phone.guess get pay for. like chunky stays put ear like new light ones don't know ear not. 
 returned ,it looks like old huge star track headset ! dated large tacky draws attention thuggish looking . didnt realize soo gaudy looking huge reason gave 1 stars work would wear work public.... taken market , think own! huge shiney! lol!!!!!!!! 
 itiem terrible plenty back ground noise static. ordered 2 find hugh mistake. 
 never felt good wearing it. pain,pain,pain!! don't waste money thing. mine 1/3 price.it hard pair. well. 
 purchased 3 retail pack. packaging &#34;plantronics&#34; name, logo, part numbers. product may chinese counterfeit. 
 spent extra bucks buy plantronics. unfortunately, quit using headset callers complained call quality. 
 don't waste money. work, cost. pay $25 worth. unless plan watching video screen smaller 20 inches would buy this. 
 well first work like 1st try got bad didn't work bought nothing don't even buy it...: 
 ordered daughter phone. looking picture according description hard case rubber outer print. needed something sturdy teenager. useless plastic first time drops , break one like one received already broke first time bumped. would seller pay closer attention desription picture 
 look cool! getting easy! sits drawer collecting dust! 
 dash mount holder garmin, loved, thought would great iphone. however, otterbox defender case phone (which love!), guess case it's heavy. mount won't keep phone upright enough see it. also, honda crv, dash slightly curved, doesn't sit well it. might good people, didn't work me. 
 looks alright didn't fit grandpas iphone 3g. fell ever took pocket. 
 agree others posted. protector applies easily privacy works well without dimming screen much. unfortunately protector thick touchscreen longer works screen applied. 
 didn't expect quality bad. three got, one uneven circle shape home button.what's really bad you've put screen protector on, won't get clear screen protector. actually see soap film like bubble screen. waited days, soap film still visible. it's extremely irritating unattractive. would recommend item all! 
 palm treo breaks. replacement (refurbished unit) breaks, second replacement unit (refurbished) breaks. overall design good, manufacturing appears lacking. 
 battery arrived time visually identical original oem battery. however, quickly lost ability retain charge requires daily recharging original oem battery lasted 3-5 days new. it's better worn 2-1/2 year old original battery replaced. 
 charged, battery lasts 6 hours without mush usage. first thought great, nice fit, appeared charge fine. maybe got lemon, maybe it's generic brand. would buy one 
 don't know got bad set, 3 way cutting. line ear hole, causes button hole misaligned top whole thing large. caused bubbles around whole rim would fit inside rim slightly higher screen. horrible qc say least. 
 bought wal-mart, three screen protectors bigger iphone 3g screen. intentionally made way screen would peel wear fast.they produce lot glare compare screen savers i've used past.scratched easily, finger prints, etc... point screen protectors suck!the best ones i've used protectors bought fry's electronics made japan. unfortunately, fry's doesn't sell anymore. 
 jmho; they'll never look good phone's screen itself; everyone know try put wind stuff stuck screen protector, creating bubbles make phone's beautiful screen look like crap. watch wonder 'gift' drives nuts, trying re-install product again, winding frustration never get quite right. month, gave screen protectors iphone; year later, still scratches (but carry mine holster, pocket tossed purse, ymmv) screen still looks pristine; guess that's used glass plastic screen. 
 purchased bluetooth would charge. emailed company sent another one wouldnt charge either. purchased blue tooth another online company would work either, go motorolla. 
 though headset works fine audio comfortable wear, recommend hold charge long. previous headsets owned lasted least week one hour day use average. one requires charging every day. 
 ordered christmas gift brother law - arrived time, clear plastic bag. box. considering cost, surprised, may return it. without box makes think feel truck, don't know i'm supposed gift planned.update: difficulties shipper, offered send box did, gift box, go find another. irritating, real problem came brother law tried use it. never worked! even took apple store try get help, good. sent back requested refund, never got refund. complained amazon gave store credit, apologized, never heard back seller! 
 materials design product far inferior cliphanger, comes without light cliphanger stick adhesive pad clear orcliphanger-universal caddy handheld devices, colors may varyor led, available cliphanger site. don't fooled thinking identical. "deluxe" smartclip's light difficult use dim. adhesive faulty. dropped phone 3 times first day (and still smartclip hand). avoid. 
 upon first receiving case, realized bottom half would fit snug top. however, since slight gap big deal, proceeded use primary case. unfortunately, less month use, case broken cracked numerous places regular use (i not, obviously, throw phone drop several times ground). color fading chipped certain areas. case absolutely horrible. recommend anyone. even low price isn't worth it. 
 guess get pay for. thing worked initially, gradually started smell like small electrical fire. 6 months occasional use, thing burned entirely.for s&gs; took thing apart. it's horribly made, design flaw practically guaranteed cause electrical failure. failure won't burn car burn iphone, stop working. 
 bought three things year ago. gave one girlfriend, one brother, kept one myself.at first worked great. within less year, failed. none work now.in short, things must kind design flaw, resulting failure months. don't waste money. many similar products market similar price. 
 amazon shall remove product vendor list.the connector fit 3g 3gs iphone, pure trash.i requested money back, much waste timeand energy. shame amazon better quality controlover products list vendors business with.if want waste time money buy product.thanks

 product work promised...it fit iphone 3g, return back. amazon prompt returning refund.. 
 don't get wrong, good case, better couple others amazon half cost free shipping prime member. contacted otterbox customer service unresponsive abrupt. three cases (two iphones) would rate behind popular one amazon.the case offer good protection, screen protector makes difficult view phones apps bright light. also snap holster hold phone wearing jacket. clip style holster barely hold phone place jacket rubbing phone enough phone fall ground. need careful grass, snow loud area hear phone fall. 
 sennheiser used reputable; must agree say earbuds junk. shorter earbud worked intermittently first (plugging unplugging sometimes cleared problem) like asymmetric form much kept hoping would 'break in'. instead, broke, shorter earbud working all. bad, back kludge-but-robust sure adapter old sony earbuds. 
 bought two these, one worked never worked all. poor quality didn't expect much so. . . . 
 cord workit broke quickwaste money dont buy even worth spending money 
 bought three need them. fall apart. part goes touch falls apart four pieces apparently impossible get back together charges. one still together. super glue along seams last order good chargers. 
 used several bt head sets..motorolas, jabras, plantronics. weapon choice plantronic 510.large, hearing-aid ish looking gave great performance dog got ahold it.introduce jabra extreme.packaging- pleasing eyes.. impressive looking made excited open it.first glance - small.. im talking small enough concerned might loose (which pro con guess)headset - small size, equated small buttons (hard use bigger hands 6'2 225..i like feature dedicated slider -on/off switch. didnt sit wait hold button power on. tiny little volume buttons made hard find hard push ear..accessories - atachments offered. hard mean hard rubber ear piece... thats it. soft gel cushion option replacement earpiece.there tiny, paperclip thin hard plastic piece slips ear hold place felt like stabbing behind ear.the power accessories nice. impressed came usb adaptor plug could charge pc work, fit car charger came with. nice!!fit - uncomfortable best. weight nice often forgot wearing it, didnt fit ears. im dumbo means..performance - great. sounded muffled would call land line cell phone wasnt much better. verizon wireless washington d.c. metro area (30 min north) vzw full service over. headset. if, middle call id switch plantronics 510, problem would resolve itself.despite nice car charger/usb adaptor, nice look/color falls short due horrible fit/feel making ear hurt wearing it, horrible performance calls.

 well, it's consistent.the stock cable came blackberry micro-usb bb end. base needs mini-usb connection. didn't fit.but then, bbbold didn't fit either; wasn't secure, looked like charging nibs would dead short metallic band around rim case ... perhaps it's well didn't cable.anyway, it's going back immediately. 
 description incorrect product match device. 
 thought 9900. ordered wrong product. error, error company product... 
 storm comes screen protector already. unless want replace orginal bubble-free protector own, need buy this. 
 battery looks like photo says rim blackberry, hold charge. fully charged, even last eight hours. battery made china, ones seem work better made japan. battery replacing made japan years use,it actually still better new made china battery. it's worth amount money - don't buy it. 
 bad battery ded reached mei call get one morei recomand dont buy blackberry standard battery 9000 bold 
 spring clip broke 40 days use. can't even return since it's 10 days past 30 day amazon return policy. yes, seido ship replacement free. doesn't address design flaw - spring clip attachment brittle break weeks. i've using holsters like since 2000 - original palm treo, blackberry, iphone. first holster i've used design flawed. save $30 get another one. 
 got ct12 (unless ct10) back 2000. loved it: saved neck pain associated tilting neck hold phone shoulder ear. sound quality great. phone worked whether docked charger roaming house. sound quality exceptional. problem ever dropped time finally, years abuse, killed it. (in fact, two phones 2000 2010, finally decided couldn't squeeze anymore life second one, also victim falls.) compared older models, ct14 terrible disappointment. i'm using location, yet constant irritating sound background. cannot used docked charger. may sound like big issue. answer phones, one get headset on, press talk button call goes voicemail. old model, steps. ct14, 3rd step -- pull phone charger, get headset on, press talk. it's easy quickly, especially headset plug pull phone quite easily. also, you're using phone inadvertently put back charger you're using sitting desk charger is, phone disconnects call. danger phone blowing giving cancer use charger, i'd interested know. otherwise, seems like design flaw. rating phone particularly low loved older model much. revalation. one terrible comparison. (if never older version, one might frustrate much me. really, okay terrible sound quality.) 
 low-grade static buzz sound one hear almost always. audible others significantly diminshes usability product. item also corded, another significant hamstring. 1 star - unusable, unsatisfactory quality, poor technology. 
 use home office it's done job far. little staticky places haven't isolated phone, vonage, conference service use.setup straight forward setting time date easy. haven't used many options phone except mute conference easy enough. headset flimsy cheap feeling especially used plantronics quality, it's job sound quality good.overall nice travel phone stays way.update - june 23rd - one year later, it's breaking.close one year later. reduced one star daily typical office use headphone starting crackle drop audio. seems connection carry base unit somehow dropping connection makes essentially useless. carries one year warranty past point help. rare actually take headphone base could caused connection issues, i'm certain lost it's audio. 
 got phone thinking would lot better was. annoyingly slow. lots bugs drives crazy. nearly every day want beat hammer. would rather one old brick phones piece junk. don't waste money!!! 
 anxiously awaited phone couple months, day finally came phone arrived disappointment was!i spent week trying "get used" feel phone, really gave every effort phone didn't work way have. know software releases make phone work way intended didn't time invest it.i'll make short point, you're business/power email user phone cramp style, try week two see. numerous times buttons screen accidentally touched camera would come different things would activate.the screen rotation system horrible 3-5 second delay landscape portrait mode mention phone awfully slow.and keep mind, wasn't phone, ordered 5 everyone complained thing, sent back. even now, weeks release people still seem disappointed "stuck" them.this would make great phone teenager still school, use blackberry make deals happen manage day phone sad disappointment!! 
 going keep short since i'm go verizon store replace "storm" (aptly named) curve. phone disaster. buggy, bugs fixed upgrades, never fix really (for me, least) difficult use touchscreen keyboard. problem nearly impossible touch nearby key keyboard slows one considerably. i've tried, really wanted phone great given features, can't stand it. also, want use keyboard, go menu, scroll (should top menu choice) select "show keyboard." that's annoyance used keyboard (a real one) right device. entering information field webpage, keyboard automatically come up. tap exactly field data entry box page (good luck that; magnify page demagnify page view entering text). user unfriendly enormous missed opportunity rim create something great. 
 easy google benchmarks details, tilt, another htc/qualcomm device well-documented, inferior multimedia capabilities compared (samsung, lg, toshiba, apple, nokia) devices. current qualcomm cpus well-documented slower even circa 2002-2003 pocketpc devices comes multimedia. it's unfortunate class-action law suite hasn't panned out.even poorly received clie nx/ux keyboards, sony hasn't improved design.it also doesn't help device delivered cracks casing whole first-batch us launch recalled. nov 28, 2008 launch "back-ordered" january, 2009. 
 don't know sure due cable software, never got work. gave got tablet (see review motorola xoom) realized bluetooth works great transfer phone's photos. price cheap wasn't worth returning. 
 bought transfer photos samsung phone. didn't work anything charger. save money go elsewhere! 
 waste time buying protect anything called shutterbox phone may brek pieces drop thing rubber it. 
 ok, many people know difference? now. get defender case hard plastic rubber. rubber case waste money, better nothing. priced same, get better one.this going back. 
 case absolutely perfect first received it. offers great protection, lightweight, doesn't slide countertop etc, comfortable hold. however, 3 months continuous use noticed placed phone call took iphone away ear use keypad, speaker, access app, end phone call screen would stay black wouldn't allow anything. went apple store thinking something wrong phone however case issue. little sensors near speaker front phone little triangle cutout case. case stretched covered sensors case removed works perfectly. 
 believe otterbox puts name product. waste money!!! junk. 
 many recent reviews noted, thing stretched month longer aligns properly earpiece, sensors, buttons. sticky rubberized cases used/seen but, still gets stuck pocket covered fair amount lint. stopped using mine went back marware sport grip case get really linty holds phone nice snug. otter "don't buy". 
 trusted otterbox cases years relied them. case fit iphone 3 phone. tried return it, vendor admit poor fit. may fluke, experience. 
 type iphone 4 case comes up? reason it! amazons fault. anybody else feel way? 
 cover sags bit sometime fit perfectly anyways. would recommend all.

 battery never made single day's use wife's phone despite &#34;breaking in&#34; several charges. would recommernd battery anyone although know price cheap compared oem batteries sold at&t. definitely don't know sure, guess, i'd say rejects recycled. 
 don't buy this, one ever hear me, repeat everything always give disconnect. 
 returned jawbone one frustrating day.all control buttons hidden view touch. attempts adjust volume cancelled calls.not recomended. 
 krusell amazon playing games product coverage. 1.5 mos purchasing, one belt loops came completely detached. amazon won't return exchange since it's month old. krusell claims lifetime warranty, completing online registration process warranty, require activation - never send! buy risk - product protected! 
 bought 3gs fit right. came adhesive ( double stick tape type ) fit top bottom, sides. placed glass, stuck fine top bottom bowed little center. problem placement. perfectly aligned. way bowed, touch screen would work properly. 
 far ordered 3 different replacement screens iphone none stay attatched mother board. digitizer ribbon snap wrong size (too big) stay attatched. checked different original apple iphone screen, make sure wasnt main board not. screen snapped fine. ribbons screens wrong 
 iphone fit case - disappointed. looking forward using case phone. 
 don't let picture wording fool you. good product. type fake leather wrapped around thin cardboard. 
 get get price. &#34;magnet&#34; close lasted day. dont waste penny 
 genuine leather ..? back piece leather, it's synthetic bad quality material. so, belt clip weeks later completely damaged ..it seems poor quality starts factory one side panels also came unstitched.a star, allow half placed .. 
 pouch looked better picture. putting protective cover iphone, scarely put iphone pouch. pouch tight kept hitting call button. use now. pouch meant iphone. seriously, know put protective cover iphone. made pouch little width. lot choices. 
 one magnetic closure, snap, wish known that, flimsy standards 
 spring unit pushes two way 12v socket. contacted seller got repsonse.update, partially melted last time used it. fire hazard? possibly. 
 closet maybe sold yard sale one day. bad purchase decision part, great concept doesn't work older vehicles 
 really excited this! wanted able charge phone use radar detector simultaneously, worked great almost month sudden stopped. nothing broken place see never moved definitely work anymore. get refund sellers polite fact remains same... work forever 
 researching ways boost cell signals found this. reading many reviews realized issue weak cell signals fixed, easily permanently, cell phone use wifi make receive calls text data. weak cell signal common problem concrete metal buildings shielding signals out. always access wifi home office. republic wireless solved problem two years ago. uses voip calling backed sprint cell verizon roaming. also works world wide wifi $5 month. service unlimited contract. unlimited call text plan $10 month, unlimited cell, text data $25 month. use phone (moto x $299 moto g $149) need republic's proprietary software work rates. using 18 months worked perfectly. 
 tries several different spots home could get good signal replicate. try another brand see works. 
 made sure compatible phone bought is. work all. excited arrived. followed instructions carefully still work, fact seemed mess wifi signal little. favor dont buy garbage. good thing get refund. 
 went great lengths make sure bought 33 dollar one direct amazom. came blackberry packaging authentic looking markings. 2 weeks it's already failing hold charge throughout day. don't know it's related unit seems reboot spontaneiously every day so- i'm talking full 10 minute reboot too, soft restart. really unhappy amazon one. bought cheaper one month ago bad right box. hard get real battery replace oem one? 
 white iphone ordered white color elago case go it. picture looks nice reality, it's cheaply manufactured plastic junk. it's plastic covered white paint plastic edge rough scratch iphone. spend money get better casing. 
 pictures would believe near mil-spec case, protecting phone shock, moisture dirt. even close. specifics...once assembled around phone, unit easily falls included belt clip. two little ears belt clip securely hold phone case place. best, case store pocket purse, although case makes phone quite bulky. phone case, charge cord cannot connected, least can't get multiple chargers work (we 11 phones). outer rubber housing, meant absorb shock thin...far thinner standard otter box soft phone cases inner yellow shell made hard, unyielding plastic, doubt case offers much real protection iphone dropped height. one, poorly conceived design meant, suspect look tough much else. otterbox defender series 3 case fails every way given poorly performs, grossly overpriced boot. 
 got money taken reply thats can't even contact them, sent otter back never got money don't waste time buying 
 otterbox rated.griffin way go.period!never buy otterbox. protective many others. sold walmart people know. 
 tilt, provide windows mobile applications video drivers spare time.easy google benchmarks details, tilt, another htc/qualcomm device well-documented, inferior (4 times slower) multimedia capabilities compared (samsung, lg, toshiba, apple, nokia) devices. fuze actually benchmarks slightly slower circa 2002-2003 200mhz pocketpc devices comes multimedia. it's unfortunate htc class-action law suite hasn't panned out.this superior keyboard compared xperia x1, greasy, finger-print attracting thin casing makes phone feel like toy. "diamond" points back case also wear less week due poor plastic quality.vga amazing device albeit wasted less 2.8" size instead useful eye-forgiving 3". actually also take photos versus blurring/stuttering tilt camera, pictures look spectacular. accelerometer-enabled album viewing takes much pain portrait vs landscape. bad album still isn't syncable picasa easy off-loading.however, new usb drive mode (directly accesses microsd/hc locks access windows mobile), makes easy transfer files, use directory-based album browser photos.the auto-backlight tends bright doesn't get dark enough dark settings. luckily there's apps levelsight deal this.hsdpa locked work around at&t;'s registry locks 3g speeds quite slow. either towers overloaded iphones, back haul towers 1mbps max.the push-to-talk useless isn't obvious way reassign button use. luckily, there's hacks google reassign two different things bring comm manager, camera app.another major issue gps really slow initial lock. take two minutes locks compared tilt. turning a-gps (without signing onto at&t; navigator) doesn't improve speed actually cause 3rd party gpss loose gps lock repeatedly (in 1 minute time span beyond) including garmin mobile xt igo8 finally getting gps lock. luckily again, there's app called fusiongpsfix attempts deal this.it's bad one company design design mostly show reliable usability.for instance destroyed d-pad. it's almost impossible hit left right 4-way direction pad pad, control surface shared 4 buttons. you're likely hit dial home sloppy press left. you're likely hit back hangup sloppy press right. limitations hit especially hard want navigate calendar program play game.combined bad d-pad design sharing surface ipod capacitive scroll capability. superficially, would nice one thumb able scroll ipod-like lists hit center button select. reality drawing circle around center button results responsive behavior, moving thumb center selection cause accidentally scrolling.it's also inane put volume ptt button side slider face makes slide! push buttons, whole face twist wiggle. really shows keyboard-slide sloppy add-on original diamond design. 
 samsung's use proprietary jack charging phone connecting headset miserable design decision, consumer's perspective. i'm sure adds bottom line. i've tried three adapters two different suppliers none work known-to-be-functional headset. giving going back bluetooth earpiece. 
 ordered 2 items shipped something totally different, shipped right item neither worked. one broken, one didnt pass sound wouldnt buy again. although kind enough give refund thats good. 
 havent gotten yet. ordered november 18th, december 9th. emailed said country gove 2 weeks. already emailed friday. so, guess kids get sometime next year. 
 piece cheap junk. well guess get pay cases. bought daughter tip broke phone day gave her.the noise hush real good.big c. 
 one end longer mic bad hate broke 2 months 
 3rd 4th pair headphones always stop working awhile. :/ always one side headphone. 
 ok one ear phone longer break u get u pay for. 
 bought second charger blackberry tour. appears charge phone, phone basically non-functional charger connected. charger removed, phone starts working, again. 
 worked couple months stopped charging phone. upset. set fire. 
 bought two spare chargers. wasted money never charged actually think ruined one phones. thank god protection plan got phone replaced. price didn't even bother returning them. may work work gs3. 
 bought gift dead arrival. maybe bad one trouble takes return something bought online much trashed it. 
 recommend it.it last long, cheaply made. please dont wast money it. pay little bit get better one. piece junk known would purchased!karlac 
 gave girlfriend use blackberry phone, said got hot stopped working. maybe charged phone twice ??? 
 like another item bought orange discount center, wasn't oem, even though said was. fault. know better. 
 least 4 sets these. run great run except one commenter's said constantly cut out. finally placed lg shoulder 10 inches away stayed contact.every one quit working 20miles. company said might due sweat getting in. sounded great hoping company would fix problem. far haven't. couch potato wants wireless head set answers phone, great. 5 stars. active sweat little, don't purchase. donnie 
 given set can't life figure people like much. sound quality great bass all, thats kind expected size. call quality superb hands free works flawlessly too. comfortable around head too. battery life also great. hate much? signal! terrible! don't expect work pair. move audio cuts out. stick phone pocket cuts point usually get frustrated shut use loud speaker. ashame really, signal issues i'd give pair 5 stars. major deal breaker! 
 sound quality awesome, limitation using outside plain dumb. two sets these- thinking first one defective. smaller enclosed spaces like offices, living room, airplane seat, etc., work great. try use large fitness center outdoors like jogging, cycling, etc., audio cuts 3-4 times minute. apparently, bluetooth receiver thing isn't sensitive depends walls bounce signal player headset. walls = poor performance. first thought first set defective. getting warranty replacement experiencing problems, read instructions. (i know, know). explain put music player back pocket, preferably high/close headset can. dumb that? find music player placed line-of-sight within 6-8 inches headset, works uninterrupted. great deal trouble jogging holding mp3 player behind head.one thing really bugs me. motorola outsourced customer service jobs outside united states. care this, (as do), might want know. 
 several copies previous version great died typically around 6 months purchase. don't know whether model still sold heavy ears. 
 never use - always cutting out, even normal telephone headset. tried multiple types phones, doesn't cut it. 
 idea motorola claim ever 'flagship' stereo bluetooth headphones. problem syncing it, installing it, figuring use buttons (though bit small annoying). however, never use it, drops syncing provocation. compared much cheaper motorola stereo bluetooth headphones (s305), simply work. sync 3 minutes drop connection. re-sync, stand exact spot listening exact music exact phone s305, s305 works fine piece carp skips drops signal. using motorola phone! (z6m)do buy s9 s10 s-anything motorola, unless like curse. questions, could s9-hd upgrade s9? s9 must used coat hook only. 
 tried s9 reviews. mistake!!! fit, wrapping around back neck pulling ears, drives crazy. used s9 imac computer. terrible time pairing.but tight grabbing neck fit totally un acceptable.exchanged jabra halo bt650s set loved jabra halo 100%. 
 got motorola s9-hd week want deal wired headphones running. product received came original box authenticity hologram attached arm.the short works, job great sound quality good. contrary reviewers, pretty comfortable fit. pairing also easy. like button placement etc. paired laptop ipod nano wireless transmitter (i10s (luxurious white) tiny bluetooth ipod transmitter ipod/iphone/ipad/itouch).i couple bluetooth headphones suitable active sports. one better job staying head, big annoying problem signal cut-offs. s9-hd frequently loose signal transmitter. cannot keep ipod reliably pocket. hold hand. thought issue wireless transmitter headphones laptop sitting directly front laptop also bluetooth headphones cut-off frequently, short distance.edit: cut-offs seems less ipod s9-hd fully charged. battery starts drain time (say hour so) cut-offs become often. either battery small fully charging fully (or both). perhaps, charge/discharge cycles situation may improve. i'll update review see improvement.edit2: cut-offs continuing month use. annoyance probably flaw device bluetooth devices problem. unfortunately, besides motorola s9 s10, bluetooth headphones suitable active sports. 
 soon plugged item in...nothing happened. work connect solid enough get car's 250 psi air compressor work. (i tried pump tire wheel barrow.) yes, compressor works fine plugged car's lighter. 
 got could plug slime comp02 12-volt tire inflator wall socket eventhough little diode lights doesn't power inflator !?not recommended. 
 i'm sure going high ratings, sent flimsy plastic case painted, poorly, black outside white inside - plastic well. quickly scratch phone nothing prevent plastic-on-plastic scratching. course, get ~$8.00 (cost plus shipping) suppose, need think twice purchase want $200 $500 phone (depending contract not) scratched days.by way, single thing rubber this. absolute false advertisement. might sent wrong item, invoice package indicate that. 
 bought one convenient way charge sync ipaq glisten. charge, simply won't connect computer via usb. tried another phone another computer. still joy. similar products market work. buy one those, piece garbage. 
 cable connection good damage devices.seems charge ok, get good cable, keep inserting-removing usb port... phone even flash charging state fast enough, that's happens cable. data keep get reconnects time point it's impossible transfer one large file. proves connectivity continuity cable connectors sucks big time. tested 2 cables.no phone shows micro disconnects charging, may even it's flashing off.will even bother returning. probably use spring mechanism cables around, one wouldn't use connect expensive phones. all. 
 ownership 3 days.today went plug phone pc pow!spring there, 3 pieces plastic broken there.yes wire still works retractable anymore!this garbage! 
 moment got product broken. pull cord extend it, it's supposed stay extended always snaps back retracted position. means keep phone one inch away pc use it. wasn't worth cost shipping get replaced. suggest purchase slightly expensive model "push button" lock keep cable extended. 
 bought item it's competitor &#34;micro usb retractable cable - ideal micro usb...&#34;. another one looks durable. one already broke another one still works. 
 honestly say product quality lasted week one ear jacks already broke mention really don't stay well ears first place 
 owned 2 bb brand headsets failed (one side stops working). replaced withaltec lansing uhp326 backbeat series ear headphone ultimate ears technology. it's expensive $30 worth it! 
 headset sucked price annoyed pay much get cruddy result. lost lots calls one could me...awful. 
 worked great 2 weeks, disconnects 5 minutes call. don't know why. reset it, reset phone, re-paired headset, could, it's useless now. returning it.also, head band bit tight -- gave headache, willing live clarity. oh well. 
 made used everyday phone gets lots use. work wire gets bent split. 
 cannot get audio 3.5 connection. tried several standard headphones. so, plugged in, phone starts auto-dialing last dialed numbered.i spent quite lot time trying understand make work. searching reading web taught slam dunk. 2.5 3.5 connectors wired number different ways support mono, stereo, mic, etc. plugs 1, 2 3 rings (respectively 2, 3 4 connectors - connector metal part rings).however htc part meant work htc mogul sprint phone - doesn't. conclusion far adapter came short defect 'short' wiring though empirical tests conclusive. example, get mono audio plugging telephone headset 2.5 connection. weird thing plug stereo standard 3.5 headphone connection (using another 2.5 3.5 adapter) get audio.after many frustrating hours came one workaround works - plug earphone proprietary port check sound, plug another one 2.5 test plug -slowly- 3.5 - gets audio unplug two.i returned mine ordered another vendor. hope part defective; shudder think supposed work problem phone itself. 
 fairly excited hear product. find iphone screen simple use, thought could get extra finesse thing.well, finess one thing have. light - sort conductive foam tip. foam tip seems quite flimsy confidence remain attached long. whole thing put together perhaps 20 cents worth stuff - gall charge $15 it.so - function:it take great deal effort effect screen finger alone. screen really read well - push far harder comfortable doing.the screen recognize - eventually - really - it's flimsy tip problem mind.overall - worth effort $$ - fingers free work far better iphone ipod touch. get nice screen protector far happier. 
 bought thing replace samsung sounded great little clunky. immediately dissapointed charger clearly designed item kind-of-half-way attaches one earphone. it's micro-usb type, something must plugged wall--not 2 usb car charger, next phone. actual headset remarkably sleek, kept open mind eight-hour initial charging session. dissapointed flat, tinny sound finally came stylish lightweight headset finally played new coldplay album android phone. audiophile sound earbuds really, really noticeably poor compared samsung replaced. like heavy deep base really let-down. summary, looks cool, it's functional, i'll wear gym, sounds substandard.update:downgraded one star. listening earphones hour, decided sound quality unacceptably poor. fortunately, amazon fantastic way handling returns able print return authorization shipping label--postage included--for full refund. first return experience amazon make less hesitant purchase items online likely choose amazon sellers. 
 headset died 2 months, warranty expired.i took look online forums seems may bought &#34;knock off&#34;. i'm expert supposedly original devices, would've expected original purchased amazon.anyway, favor buy lg headset. it's durable, battery indicator, doesn't die light use. 
 sony seem care customer needs. behaving stubbornly another proprietary charger instead simply using universal usb serious companies use. want force us carry another charger?when sony going care customer needs instead thinking extract pennies us? 
 means audiophile - people say good sound crazy - excited iphone got 3.0 update thought sure stereo bluetooth finally evolved (based reviews) --my first experience motorola s9 - sounded crappy too. look awesome box - sound quality terrible - songs purchased itunes makes differnece -- sound made basically unusable -- found previous bt stereo headsets - oh well -i guess 'll keep waiting. 
 total waste time. folks, learn hard lesson i've learned, order items frm prime certified sellers. ohterwise, dont know youre getting, spending money like going vegas. gamble. 
 battery came quickly good condition. it's cell seems working fine. true test next week i'm work. far good looks like would purchase future. update next week. 
 purchase battery spare blackberry phone. placed battery phone didn't even recognize it. plugged charger light continued red two hours. sinced moved lost great still phone original battery works fine. don't buy it's waste good money. 
 refurbished, believe. terrible batteries. going buy these, would recommend buying least 3... bought 1. didn't work. soon got package, swapped batteries old one blackberry. charged 3 hours checking battery level. stuck 90%... unplugged phone wall charger,the battery died within 30 minutes. doesn't hold charge. wow. $7 good true good battery. ($7.00 shipping.) 
 apparently listing error amazon. happen persist time.the cable measures 33 inches long, that's even 1 meter, much less 1.5 meter.i quarrel amazon marketplace vendor bought amazon. mistakes happen.however, need 1.5m (65 inch) cable do, won't do.yes, cable work, described, ordered thought getting. thus, 1 star: product described product get.jerry 
 read 1.0m 1.5m. got cable clearly showed (on bag holding cable)that 1.0m. contacted vendor ask told check blackberry switched cable vendor. wouldn't touch product work vendor. 
 it's pity. worked fine got 1.5 "cupcake" update g1 phone. recognized phone, it's useless. 
 charge car charger work cd player 3.5mm aux outlet time. buy male/male audio chord plug htc headphone jack wire comes phone. looking using 3.5mm jack adapter, going useless. phone won't recognize market headphones plugged it, unless buy "sound route switcher" app market.overall, works great roadtrips but, good taking walk jogging. adapter add weight phone. 
 phone connected internet via wifi yet gave many freezing problems internet. ended nokia 5530 freezing problems happy phone. cannot recommend nokia 5800 freezing problems. think 5800 pretty phone big screen freezing problems...oh well, life goes on! glad nokia 5530! 
 fir phone forgot send back. screen battery resembles one phone received completely different battery. shoulda sent back forgot 
 got phone little sister.... broke first week overall couldn't lot... fav.

 must say price awesome.. might gotten bad ones.. wouldnt stay on.. :( 
 broke days using never going buy waste money good luck everyone else 
 junk. terribly disappointed lack quality sweatshop made covers have. feel like cardboard painted clear polymer. huge rip off. 
 bought "leather" iphone 5 case received iphone 5. phone arrived case, took long time coming. know better order anything amazon prime, case looked good "description". nowhere box say case leather. took out, sticky look feel plastic coated fabric. even fabric grain. also know better order seller, dismal experiences ordering cases devices. arrive don't fit right, return pay almost cost purchase. worth way around. case protect iphone 5 anything, let alone fall; feel downright off-putting. seems like hastily made case try cash iphone 5 rush--but couldn't even get time plenty pre-order time. order case expecting leather; world would sell supposed retail $49.95 immediately reduced $9.95 ever came out. opportunistic way cash 5 needs without providing quality usable product, severely misrepresenting this. buy, unless willing write don't like it, return cost--even defective misrepresented product. 
 uncomfortable, people could hear well all; would stay ears. sent back. 
 i've 2. used one set broke 4 days. believe damage sweat. power button quit working. sent one back regretted getting refund first place. owned multiple bluetooth headphones know normal range is. poor range. disconnect line site. especially outside. work these! sweat break them, range play music pocket outside. 
 bought 906 version identical 903, adds bluetooth transmitter dongle non-bluetooth devices.this 4th plantronics bluetooth device 2nd stereo bt. taking back day use reasons:1) uncomfortable. hate ear phones love earbuds(or canal phones in-ear-monitors). seem somewhere in-between. 30 minutes ears hurt. granted, i've using sony earbuds last 8 years, that's comparing to. wear buds 8+ hours discomfort, i've wearing backbeats 3.5 hours today they've uncomfortable throughout. get one size i'd say average small ear canals.2) sound alright. i'm coming 8 years $60 earbuds sony. lot treble sound tinny me. much better experience older plantronics 855 stereo bluetooth used earbuds similar sonys. like defined bass gives rock alternative music punch. backbeats make music familiar sound much less dynamic. use bass boost option music. think people fine sound, discerning listeners look elsewhere. feature called openmic supposed allow hear outside world better press button. problems hearing around option turned off, one 2 settings adds low static hum.3) made one phone call 30 minutes driving car windows 5 minutes friend told take back difficult understand voice sounded "hollow". functional, transparent. end, problems understanding friend complaints receiving.on positive note, buttons backbeat worked expected htc incredible. able pause, back track forward track songs, adjust volume. pairing easy. use meridian music player incredible backbeat controls well. go meridian player's preferences turn headset controls allow control pandora, last fm slacker. slacker sounded terrible - seemed dramatic lack bass i've read known problem slacker using wi-fi.battery life seems great. i've listening music made 40 minutes phone calls last 4 hours backbeat battery indicator shows still 1/3 2/3's full. i'm willing use longer due ear discomfort.the ear design wasn't bad thick arnette sunglasses on. add baseball cap top you've got problem. cord behind neck solid, others noted, want lay back head pillow headrest, significantly apply pressure ears really highlights uncomfortable backbeat wear.the separate dongle get 906 model worked expected. go pairing process time switched incredible dongle. i'm sure better way, didn't seem automatic initial pairings.bottom line, don't bother trying unless take back full refund. look good on, don't fit right, think going disappointed. i've also read may huge reliability issues backbeat seem hold sweat probably avoid costs. 
 i've little less year. bought last may stopped working! still probably buy another set $40 cheaper buy $15 wired earbuds last month. want manufacturer admit sweat proof make pair really water proof done! 
 device pull shelf toss trash.they need refund customers. tuck ears. hold hands listen nobody want it. idiot approved project step find another bright person 
 bought use iphone 4. worked great 24hrs. controls worked life great. call quality sound good. second day, pause button stopped working couldn't change tracks anymore. resetting reconnecting didn't good. sent back looking options.believe me, wanted like product...and worked. maybe you'll better luck, price luck shouldn't anything it. sorry plantronics. 
 product seems decent. quality good etc. however advertised fitting galaxy nexus, not. galaxy nexus want phone fit completely case don't buy this. won't. sticks top, screen part sticks used disply doens't look good. dissapointed price paid this. recommned larger phones all. 
 received broken, didn't offer replace it. get pay for. buy!!!! 
 purchased charger samsung google nexus phone, quite disappointed. believe might technically able charge phone use, meet needs. unable charge phone use navigation. best, keeping phone charge. believe 700mah charger, 2000mah charger much better job. ymmv, i'd suggest looking elsewhere. 
 made china.the quality samsung unit questionable.the two halves case line correctly, excess molding around front insert 12v cig lighter. sticker crooked.i think thing fake. works fine girlfriends samsung galaxy, doesnt work lg. came small zip-loc style bag information.i'd avoid get different unit. owned samsung products past never released anything poorly built this. 
 don't work, simple that. tried 3 cars house case. i'll buy another another source. shipped time normal-good package. 
 read reviews ordered item. don't buying samsung s3. snail pace charging. wasted money. 
 receive charger 10 day stop work hourpiece junk pleas buy don't spent money charger 
 samsung chargers like one before, honestly don't last long all. don't understand crap easily, advised taking chance. 
 worked fine 3 months stopped charging, swapped couple cars effect. checked fuse wasn't blown; stopped working. 
 looks like it's built well engraved &#34;samsung&#34;, nothing trouble charger. fits loose socket wire wiggled held position constant charge. def loose connections. vendor sent replacement wound thing. recommend product. 
 highly disappointed product. mention received product fits little loose actual car charger. charges phone now. really thought wouldn't buy another charger while, looks like wrong! bought usb car charger (i hook usb cord phone charger) 3$ walmart product lasts longer durable. find quite sad would never buy product again. it's like threw money window go find another product. 
 bought charger didn't work. obviously wouldn't buy again, frustrating plug phone never charge. 
 originally wrote review stated charger actually worked. did. unfortunately, couple months died. don't know happened, throw out. don't waste month this. it'll end place mine did... trash. 
 item cheaply made fell apart multiple places within months. microusb port got twisted bent would connect. dc plug section came unglued/attached wire got loose. whole unit basically opened could closed way would stay closed. throw whole piece junk trash. recommend product price. 
 within weeks phone certain angle charge. then, wires inside wore out. don't buy it. 
 confirmed suspicion purchasing real oem samsung charger comparing product side side. cheaply made chinese knock-offs. stay away these. don't work!!!!

 cheap. didnt really work uncomfortable. beware product. although inexpensive worth money. trust me. 
 everyone couldn't understand headset iphone 4s...they said voice garbled would cut out. :(i ended buying plantronics one instead (see link below) works much better! complaints one whatsoever. initially went samsung trusted name brand. don't make mistake did!plantronics m50 - bluetooth headset - retail packaging - black 
 motorola bluetooth died many years use. coincidentially samsung wep 460 sale seemed bargain buyer beware, get pay for.with motorola bluetooth open thing attach ear unit turns on. remove close ear thing shuts off. samsung wep460 pushed turn pain neck get used extra step. forget shut taking power stays battery get drained.worse fact charger comes standard ac adaptor recharging inside home. way packaging is, charger hidden inside plastic bubble container hidden behind black paper. look closely back packaging image 1 millimeter shown -- look closely fine line drawing know charger inside ac indoor use.we routine using bluetooth driving car charging car leaving bluetooth charger car time. don't presently cigarette lighter car recharger fits samsung wep460 would another purchase us (therefore raising price cost owning unit vs motorola bluetooth). today see compatible cigarette lighter car charger sells msrp $45 expensive samsung wep460 bluetooth unit seems crazy!the sound quality fine.we regret purchase. next time we'll buy motorola bluetooth.we also learned lesson cost accessories accessory charger units. replacing existing accessories save money purchasing accessories compatible charging units already own. 
 uncomfortable. none different ear buds fit ear could barely hear sound highest volume. 
 can't believe samsung puts name piece junk. mean, would sell product , designed fit ear, held place flimsy piece plastic? warning things come fact 2 ear clips came unit. and, 2 clips break, piece unusable.so, get pay for!junk. 
 got found fit like brick ear, changed phones would sync new phone. still it, using target practice. 
 like keep reviews short simple. don't buy item bbry 8900. look elsewhere quality product. 
 looked cheap work ipod touch. broke trying unplug it. got response supplier. 
 fell apart two weeks good quality item would recommend anyone looking purchase cord. 
 bought replacement husband's iphone. previously noel collection case came mirror screen protector. product compared old screen protected extremely poor quality. mirror faded active mode makes screen green/blue color.i know cheap recommend going better quality ones. went buy better one pay shipping again, don't make mistake. 
 screen protector thick therefore, easy apply. however, mirrored surface makes display phone dark best invisible bright light. makes glare cannot see through. plan return even though it's much money. 
 screen protector performs shown. tell barely see screen applied. increased brightness 100% still hard time seeing screen. 
 buy product, worth money! mirror effect blurry can't see anything. service great product worth it! 
 expected mirror screen protector like one iphone right now. instead, it's cheap funhouse mirror type mirror...who wants look that?? 
 work well. cannot see mirror portion difficult apply. would try product similar future. 
 didnt fit iphone cheaply made came fast iwas suprise fast got didnt fit 
 nearly impossible put without getting bubbles dust.... went 5 gave completely. 
 product slighhhhhtly bigger iphone screen, big enough leave bubbles edge matter aligned. spent time try fit gave second sheet decide throw away whole package.don't bother buy it. 
 don't waste time product. backing peel off, can't use them. screen protector appears thin, couldn't tell sure b/c couldn't actually get protector order apply phone. little tab side help peel it, simply wouldn't separate backing screen protector--i returned defective even though it's much money--it's principle thing. cheap, shoddy stuff. 
 another gentleman gave product one star said me. product tab help put protector phone... tab come completely left sort ugly goo scratch smear off. way get bubbles package come card help remove bubbles. used 3 5 screens far look horrible. sure others gave one star. 
 there's reason cheap - guessed, find better one, do. seller probably trying get rid inventory loss.- size off; doesn't cover glass entirely - it's narrow long. comes protectors, even half mm pain. that's even know put on, you're gonna go make adjustment wrong sizing. went two.- plastic super cheap fingers glide it. means get sticky, like there's kind glue it. also means you're gonna able get bubbles out. still two small bubbles can't push underneath.- probably biggest problem - plastic film cheap rainbow effect; look angles, see rainbow unevenness going across horizontally. it's like see mix water gasoline. it's annoying.save trouble disappointment - don't buy product. 
 terrible protection glossy bubbles ridiculously horrible. came pack five went 2 days. sucks 
 horrible quality, get pay for. reminds plastic comes fruit roll up. never buy again, bought something else shipped together thought free ones sent compliment. 
 waste money put white paper tab put phone can't get stupid tabs them. 
 "protectors" love smudges oil fingers. protect screen, major disappointment. look elsewhere. 
 left lot bubbles applying. spent good amount time trying work still remain. writing 16 month old daughter pulled phone sooo aren't sticky either. i'll throwing out. waste money. don't buy. 
 five protectors bent would adhere iphone edges. poor quality. i'd rate zero stars allowed. 
 took forever receive since come china. also, almost impossible install without getting speck dust air bubble it. looks like crap. buy good case. 
 like product. difficult apply screen. air bubbles terrible get screen. 
 screen protectors came part combo purchase recommended amazon. ordered charge/sync cord wall charger iphone best price available included screen protectors. needed replace one phone scratch, nothing minor putting off. arrived pulled old protector, cleaned screen phone carefully started put first one. apparently came dust already attached sticky side ended small bubble protector. also noticed noticeable kind swirly rainbow look lights office. decided since got five would try again. managed get bit crooked first try discovered rainbow effect again. since three left decided give one last try. got straight time ended piece dust underside protector rainbow effect still there.don't waste money these. threw last two away. 
 didn't work even charged 24 hours. tried many ways nothing. included headset wall charger. instruction manual included. returned seller expense shipping charge. waiting full refund seller said so. 
 plantronics 220 doesnt work. pairs, connects, gives static filled connection even holding phone hand two feet away. garbage. plantonics voyager 510 - thats headset-- leave phone thirty feet away goes two walls distance. 220- garbage. also, beware buying called motorola bluetooth earpieces 'bay auction site. mostly counterfeit work poorly real plantronics 220. 
 wanted date last review. still haven't recieved order apprently lost mail company said may 20 would resend order. three day shipping info see 
 work! buy stuff sold by: oem shopthey mailed 2 different cable damage! 
 many third-party cables, doesn't fit phone well original. one got feels "gritty" attaching it, like it's grinding connectors shouldn't be. known better.update: expected, broke normal usage less 1 month. avoid. 
 good.this product never worked advertised.when plug computer get warning iphone quote. "this device supported iphone"so thought hmm maybe telling truth(iphone) left hooked 6 hours charge 1 %.the company contacted last negative review gave product. sent another. review second one.i give one wants them. opps first one trash. use product doesn't advertised do. 
 cable went bad month $3 bucks guess cant complain. spend extra $$ buy original. 
 hurts ear,where corner back side presses ear starts hurt, sound ok best, wont get loud enoff. 
 although comfortable headset ever worn, one could hear unless angles juuuuust right face. worst all, unless phone 2 ft away headset, stay connected. either hold phone place shirt pocket. returned 1 week.i recommend headset. 
 sound 20 longer current model, price dropped significantly--i paid around $20 mine. price good bargain anyone wants plain vanilla headset decent sound quality. find sound excellent--far superior bluetooth headset i've used. device simple thus easy use, design notch better devices there. fit, device sits ear rather it, though optional ear loop. find nestles comfortably ear don't notice it's there. downsides it's current model number things can't do, addition find range great--sound degrades rapidly earpiece direct line phone device.the device one multicolored led difficult see looking directly it. mine came original packaging additional ear pieces black blue can't comment color. need headset (earpiece) calls (no music) live without voice recognition, good buy.update changed review three one star: product ok worked item's internal battery stopped holding charge less year. even though moderately inexpensive, that's substandard performance opinion since item worthless can't hold charge. 
 got acc stop end may. daughter stay connected. probably charged phone maybe 6 times since doesn't use much. died vacation never accepted charge back up. bad battery. 
 searched samsung galaxy s3 charger product popped up. received mail even fit phone. 
 cables great stuffing bag, using home car. they're stiff, cables thin enough avoid bulky.** update **after strange charging issues last months, i've determined cables carry data little charge, regardless whether power coming battery pack, wall wart, car charger, single usb port, y-cabled double usb port.on hand, it's strong flexible enough tie door open. 
 cables look like primary picture. extremely short big head it. look every picture, end fault. alternatively, shouldn't look every picture primary picture complete false advertisement looks like.the cord also falls phone easily. don't bump it.i would end losing money return this, i'm stuck it. best advice give spend little money get one actually looks like falsely lead believe look like.the shipping took 2 weeks well. track items company. emailing them, got email back saying, "it end week, way us know when". 2 weeks 3 - 5 business days. 
 bought use charge cell phone, plugged left overnight. next morning, said fully charged,unplugged charged even bit... may work some, didn't work me! 
 cable work galaxy s4. clearly samsung oem (which obvious price) work makes piece garbage. 
 cable didn't work got - pinching correct spot phone end seemed make work, obviously internally defective.seller immediately refunded me. 
 hard make charging cable? bought two galaxy nexus nexus 7, don't work. tried car charger ac charger (both work extremely well cables). car charger got nothing, ac charger one would work ac wiggled enough, nothing. worked usb instead ac. got results galaxy nexus nexus 7. absolute junk, stay away. 
 sent charging cords three different places hoping one would work samsung sii phone. one charge all. one ordered wireless hub, brooklyn, ny worked immediately. 
 stopped working week. get pay for. least dollars. 
 work zte warp samsung preval. order (6) i'm stuck shame me! 
 weeks broke! it's really hard find cheap quality replacement usb cable. one. 
 cheap! flimsy! worth even low price, waste money. lasted maybe week. even worth returning. 
 received cable immediately noted deviated pictured obviously cheap, fake cable. used although unfortunately necessitates removing sgs3 speck case. today discovered months occasional use, stopped transmitting data all. back using original cable came phone.do favor, pay little bit more, buy quality motorola branded cable. 
 bad samsung imitation. work. cable get loose connection doesn't work. though deal time failed. 
 cable dont work...im dissapointed , cable junk, cannot believe sent cable doesnt work , waste money time!!!!!! ahhhhhhrrrr s*** 
 horrible. stretch long all. wanted plug phone wall, would sit floor. plug usb worked one phone. 
 aware product.it's real samsung product. ordered 4 cables every serial numbers same.it's really faked one may break phone.the pin tight use long time, phone's usb jack would fit genuine samsung usb cable.shame hongkong!i'm going claim now!update 5/4/12: got email seller refunded full amount keep one star review faked one (useless). 
 got replace charger cable thos cable waste money, order charge phone certain angle, tried wife's phone wiggle find right angle witch charge phone. smart spend little get better cable. 
 bough single cable work all. price cheap went ahead ordered two more. worked perfectly. guess doesn't make decision easier huh? 
 bought pair cables took almost 3 weeks arrive expected issues there. first arrived doa, never worked. second died shortly less week use. cables short barely reach anywhere. forced inside phone connector made cringe every time. looking charging cable, look elsewhere, even two dollars, cables simply worth it. 
 failed approximately six months use. would buy future. would come better purchasing one store. 
 like others said reviews, cable seem well-made all. tried use past several weeks. sometimes charges sometimes doesn't--when does, charges slowly--like 4 hours go 40% 100%. half time, computer doesn't even recognize phone plugged in. recommend product. 
 equipment obviously samsung product. takes bare minimum 2 hours (uninterrupted) charging time get full charge cable even batter dies quicker usual. would recommend product anyone else. purchased 2 horrible 
 cords looked good got them. decent quality, especially paid. used connect galaxy s4 computer. phone said charging computer never able connect. big deal since figured i'd use usb plugs next bed whatnot. woke next morning phones battery percentage actually gone down! figured messed accidentally turned power strip something. wasn't case maybe didn't plug phone good enough. decided take one work keep plugging many things none working connected s4 computer took note time battery percentage. one hour battery went 2%!! what! giving cords benefit doubt time time finally found best place them, trash can. thanks nothing. 
 despite description pictures "samsung" usb data cable, received generic micro usb cable bears resemblance whatsoever pictured line. would purchased known would receive cheap generic substitute instead. 
 actually discharged samsung note 2. bought 3 none worked. haven't checked see access pictures music phone yet, point meaningless. buy cords charge. 
 completely re-written review. cable works devices except google nexus 4. bought three cables, none work nexus 4. however, cables seem charge transfer data nexus 7, motorola droid 4, & samsung galaxy tab 3. connect cable nexus 4, phone would sporadically charge disconnect every seconds.do buy concerned device incompatible cable. 
 cables don't even charge phones. tell aren't official micro-usb end thicker plastic official samsung cables. bought seller named touch global. ended shipping pakistan somewhere, cant bother return i'll count loss pay proper quality next time. 
 maybe didn't read description thouroughly enough cord sure didnt work samsung precedent phone prepaid/pay-as-you-go plans. disappointed couple bucks... 
 charger broek within two days getting help returning falty. would recomend 
 seller amamax shipping junk 3 foot generic charging cable. cable break within week. micro usb end let loose insulation render cable useless almost immediately. others good luck oem products, amamax ship oem products, take week ship it... 
 bought charge nexus devices (4 7), maintain constant connection. plugged nexus 4 using cables, charging notification flickers, suggesting constantly losing connection reconnecting. doesn't happen micro usb cables i've used. 
 fake. even get phone recognize cord, takes something like 12 16 hours fully charge. absolutely acceptable. 
 again, product description says oem samsung ... data cable... cannot get work unless "giggle" connection phone. i've tried phones get problem. give trying find mini usb cable connect properly samsung phone. 
 came date good thing it. short isn't worst problem ! doesn't stay phone. takes phone forever charge. i'm charger makes percent go instead 
 brought 3 around house. first one worked fine 3 months failed (no charge, data). switched charger still charge. tried using two (both still original packaging). didn't worked. would transfer data charge phone battery. put original phone charge cable charger worked fine knew cable charger. make sure, tried several chargers. nothing. threw three out. total waste money. it's 3 months could return order. buy again. would give zero star possible. disappointed. 
 seriously, don't make last. pretty sure went two three these. thought made great find replacement cable gs2. threw away. would connect well loose wouldn't charge. hardest time finding right cable. ironically found amazing short super long one work awesome. short nokia ca-101d 8-inch connectivity cable nokia (search amazon) connects well solid. also work gs3 don't own. long mediabridge high speed usb 2.0 a-male micro-b cable - 6 feet (also amazon) amazing quality, increadibly long! good luck searching. hopefully two suggestions help find answer. 4 5 different micro usb chargers two mentioned best!!!!! 
 bad quality, short, thin breakable. recommend buying blue rigger 6ft usb cable. cheaper much much better quality. don't waste money this. 
 it's even worse phone pocket bend over, sound (sometimes) cut every second two i'm holding phone 18" away. checking motorola warranty, really disappointing. 
 originally bought s9's, sounded o.k., failed one 30 minute workout moderate sweating. said review going try jaybird's, liked s9's much decided try s9 hd's instead. read s9 hd's much improved sweat resistance. true.on positive, say comparison s9's s9 hd's far sound quality. hd's simply blow older model away. happy initially, although paranoid earlier short lived experience, found constantly wiping headphones make sure didn't get wet working out. well, even didn't work. sadly 3 workouts, failed. time headphones still function, well volume controls, however pause, phone, forward/back controls failed. sigh...i really want like headphones, obviously appropriate product want use workouts. least decency fail within 30 day return period!this time actually order jaybirds instead. know don't audio quality do, hopefully function week!update: looked review morning, decided harsh rating 1 star (although can't go back change that). really good far sound quality, aren't using workouts, probably really like them. it's time ever use headphones workouts, least unacceptable. 
 decided totally rewrite review. finally started using hoping could cope worst bluetooth range ever seen date, sorry, can't take it.pros:the sound quality great. it's best i've ever bluetooth headphones.i haven't sweat problems gym like people seem had.they lightweight, although would nicer lower could lay on.cons:the rubber glue holding power button rubber unglued itself.the battery life 5 hours... bad size, really great either.motorola technical support worst ever conceived, it's joke even call that.they bend pretty easy - take road trip, make sure don't /any/ weight them. mine bent left pretty heavy took time bend back.but real meat potatoes worst wireless range history wireless.i put phone hood get sound cut nonstop. pockets? sorry, sol. like working out? works, kind of. biking phone pocket long lost dream. didn't buy - ht820 (which way amazing compared these) went warranty, sent back. charger, manual, nothing box (and weren't even bubble wrapped!) contacted it, said warranty expired. might due fact took nearly 3 weeks get response. getting rma previous set bad never buying motorola again.overall, really dislike headphones practical use. look 1 star reviews, you'll see have.i cannot repeat enough: buy these, save horrors piece trash (for lack better words)update: upgraded nokia bh-905i - like bt headphones i'm going throw money away another pair losers. sound doesn't cut (new) phone new pair - still old (these). upgrade phone (from wrote top part review), tested bt range, sadly, problem lie headphones. want like them, problems, nothing like. 
 first bluetooth headset bought. first days worked ok noticed recharge every couple hours used. started hearing lot static noice (i walking around, sitting next laptop). bottom line, don't waste money, reason headset cheap. knows maybe expensive one better job. 
 actually kept turning dont know reason yea didnt work really bad one ! sorry 
 bought product link 6 months ago, one ok. latest purchase, however, lasted 3 weeks, hold charge, drops rapidly zero couple hours. again, one six months ago fine phone. 
 recently ordered new battery another seller friends g1 longer holding charge. battery worked better expected. g1 battery began die quickly even limited use figured i'd get new battery mine well. battery work well ordered. battery seems work bad original one i've years.when received it, 70% life decided fully charge let completely die recharging. i've using days charge fully night. end day, around 5 6pm me, it's less 20%. rarely use phone day i'm work. even tried taking autosync feature save battery life. last night usual fully charged battery. i've checked email received/sent text messages. it's noon battery 44%!i believe lower priced batteries actually work. don't think one them. try risk. i'm thankful didn't spend alot this. 
 ordered phone days ago arrived today. initially excited got package fast even though took advantage using free shipping. soon:my excitement turned suspicion, surprise finally angry:(suspicion) box felted bit light(surprise) seal box broken(angry) phone inside box!!!it manual wall charger phone. ridiculous, even april fools' day yet!i contacted amazon immediately another phone way door. purchased countless items amazon, new used, never received empty box. appreciate amazon's effort resolving problem quickly, still looks amazon getting comfortable #1 e-retailer long, wake up, amazon.com! 
 ordered pair these. one lasted single charge, second didn't work all. could given product zero stars, would have. worth postage return - kept removable usb cables, threw adapters away. 
 bought reading good review it. well, good quality. however, thick stay loose phone. point good quality cover sit tie phone use it? well, can't use it, cheap return, threw away. recommend it. 
 heard bose version style product could afford $300, tried $50 version.1st: battery cover flimsy: difficult snap afraid going break it.2nd: stream horrible. maybe got lemon, every 2 three seconds sound would stop start again... irritating.3rd: blinking blue night also huge irritation! stop blinking make steady.------------------my wallet said, &#34;spracht!!!&#34; coughed dough toy. 
 husband & using at&t; - i'm iphone, not. resisted getting iphone & met couple years ago, experienced dropped calls rarely. whenever speaking, speaking anyone else iphone, lose signal 3 times minimum re-dial. notorious problem iphone experienced minor improvement software updates.i frequently lose signal strength areas greater dfw metroplex. anxious try kit could make phone accessible (ie, flopping around passenger seat next emergency brake) reduced dropped calls.there adhesive mount a/c vent mount included. learned experience never put adhesive dash. live texas sun comes summer, volcanos send sympathy cards asphalt! adhesive turn runny, sticky unable hold onto anything weight postage stamp car sits hot texas sun. i've always strongly mechanically inclined fiddle a/c vent mount 45 minutes finally threw hands air modest defeat. decided ok hang one side bounce around - could get better signal strength.in fairness, new vw beetle... known large sloping dashes, steep angled windshields, etc. may good way mount beetle 'universal' kit.sliding phone cradle getting properly mount 30 pin connector one-handed procedure. take mount a/c vent pull plastic front get iphone 3gs finally properly seat onto connector. frustrating trying get cradle onto vent, trying remove it.i watched video, followed instructions step step mounted magnetic antenna. disappointed see antenna came kit wired matter mounted antenna, access cable someone could vandalize. live city like dallas, people cut cords fun. ran lengthy (nice length routing along door/floor trim) cable seat side interior beetle ran cord top hatch back rubber trim protected cord crimped. small antenna strong magnet - strong enough keep thing mounted even strong winds. sometimes go mall shopping put jacket top things don't want people getting tempted by. cunning thief need tug antenna notice cord, pull cradle along car interior move jacket way see underneath. no, won't able pull whole kit-n-kaboodle car without breaking glass, something think about. kit provides list available antennas, including glass mount would avoid problems, acquired kit. it' shame glass mount antenna included get-go.after going frustration, drove around made calls. areas know typically get less 5 bars, saw improvement. i'd unseat phone pop cradle - familiar charging beep could heard battery symbol showed lightning bolt - seated - antenna securely attached, cable crimped - improvement. improvement, two people called said echo talked. minute i'd pull phone cradle, echo would go away. using apple-provided earbuds, speaker phone.during demo video, viewer clearly see improvement signal strength. saw improvement. could car area live, know underwhelmed either way frustrated difficulty getting iphone cradle (this without case phone, course) trying mount cradle car. 
 put new battery cellphone waste money. cellphone dies every day battery low. don't bother buying this. 
 don't waste time. item came ripped arrived never fit old iphone. keep looking something else! 
 wanted something sturdier protect iphone. thought flimsy sturdy enough protection. would recommend case. 
 product terrible, cut up, smelled bad, fit phone like promised. would recommend people purchase. get otterbox yeah range 15-50$ amazon protect phone greatly otterboxes best cases around. 
 cheap also cheap made, better idea spend money get better product would say 
 didn't like product all. feels super cheap didn't provide drop protection. better cases price range. 
 nice color, thats it. texture/ material made rough slip jean pockets. kinda slipped around phone, also collected much lint materials... wouldnt get 
 it's perfect condition slides phone i'm using way. it's apple iphone 3gs. 
 received worked probably first 4 times zipper broke. would use zipper twice day disappointed broke quickly. guess get pay enexpensive material well. 
 way big carry pocket (unless it's big jacket pocket. needed place put bluetooth would protect could keep pocket wouldn't lose 3rd (or 4th) bluetooth headset. useful somebody large purse keep losing headset - you'll find puppy!so i'm still looking something keep bluetooth headset i'm using want quick access. 
 sadly,. though description says plantronics voyager pro headset fits case - not. even close. unfortunately discarded packaging cannot return three purchased. fault. also, zipper closure tight point almost impossible open close. lesson learned - order 1, check fit, keep packaging return fit description wrong. 
 cousin got phone, 2 replacements never wet even abused phone any. screen going out, turning rainbowish colors. second phone seems working, neither us seem think impressive phone 
 cheap. small childred didn't cost much. wasn't long broken. 
 earphones m&m;'s theme, kind cute idea. looking economic earphones, young children concerned appearance, rather sound quality, might consider them.if want decent sound however, save money look elsewhere. sound quality muddy, heavy bias low end. high frequencies reproduced well, regular music, even hard make vocals. addition, build quality appears cheap side, areas. cord thin, probably prone breakage.perhaps earphones intended small children, package come tiny silicone earbuds attached, small adults wear. larger sized earbuds included (loose inside package, don't lose them). install larger earbud, first need remove tiny one (don't tear it!). technique attaching larger earbud. turn inside out, attach stem speaker, push edges get back proper shape. large sized earbuds installed, get snug fit, probably one cuts much ambient sound.these phones may look cool some, that's positive. reproduce sound well, may last long. fit comfortable, earbuds get torn, probably need buy new earphones, spare set earbuds provided.if looking earphones price range, sound better, better job cutting ambient sound, available variety colors, spare set earpads, take look jvc's marshmallow series. 
 battery original equipment; work phone great choice mother. 
 bought phone didn't even work. happy all. one moments wish would put extra money first time. 
 purchased first bluetooth headset thought cute. bad idea. poor, patchy sound quality speak say echoey hard hear. smaller ears uncomfortable wear. returning different headset. 
 knew could make basic thing cutting piece cardbard size, would saved order hassle. flimsy item can't believe positive reviews. wife thought trash threw away left counter. doesn't adjust securely hold droid. purchased take family self portraits didn't hold proper angle. comfortable risking droid's safety placing thing. cetainly wouldn't try interact droid's screen holder. 
 didn't like product. wasn't sturdy ended sending right back. don't waste money one. 
 piece plastic crease center quasi folds. silicon "feet'? silicon scraps pushed called feet. sure, don't slip, soon put pressure ipod, thing collapses. junk. pure, marketing junk. nothing load bollocks. metal, would something easily made piece packaging plastic, wish known flimsy would be. there's effort spent company branding materials. never again. 
 office, years, used theplantronics cs70/hl10 dect 6.0 bundle wireless headset system lifterand love it. fits perfectly, full volume microphone adjustments don't notice me.i also used theplantronics voyager 510 bluetooth headset [retail packaging] primary headset previous motorola razr loved it. however, switched iphone 3gs, people couldn't hear well anymore.upon first using voyager pro, person sounded digitized 510. also, biggest problem headset -- person sounds quiet, tinny distant. tried various earpieces without felt cover, same. comparing 510 model, 510's earpiece goes much deeper ear canal, getting speaker deeper in, creating better sound sealing sounds. even pushing voyager pro, earpiece collapses instead going deeper in.i hearing issues volume way windows car. windows down, would impossible hear.i wasn't impressed controls voyager pro compared 510 either. power button difficult find push compared 510. volume button difficult distinguish one another. 510, different slope, making easy know which. answer/hang up/voice dial button forces smash whole headset ear canal activate difficult know whether pressing it. 510, could hear button pushed let could easily counteract force thumb behind, keeping earpiece crushing ear.this usable me, returning it. back drawing board. 
 bluetooth lasted less week... 15 really interested dual speaker clarity pick up. worth price, setup flimsy cheap. broke quickly... 
 go lot head sets going one going different-as going send back! thing big might well try tape phone ear. behind ear that! big feels (too me) someone tugging ear! uncomfortable actually painful!sound quality? maybe bad one? static filled, loud enough clear. sometimes phone pocket work clearly. 3 feet away!now real downside....i good recommendation but, ordered 5 different brands/types tried before.someone make good bluetooth headset. endeavor find one. 
 couple months headset give bad review. perform well iphone often callers say speech sounds warbled scratchy. further, it's uncomfortable wear feels heavy behind ear. also cannot wear sunglasses it.i get much better mic quality either holding iphone ear without headset, using wired one came it.i regret purchase plantronics. 
 best sound useability replaced several times warranty. guess one occasional user 5 star one heavy user i.e. daily user - many one stars. would fix failures would clear winner. 
 warned microusb cable cannot used sync wm6.5 smart phones pc. htc pure won't work cable, works fine original cable comes phone device. apparently microusb cables same.

 bought mifi thinking would swap aircard i've using verizon several years. attracted ability 5 devices share one connection.overall device allow 5 devices share connection. speeds decent - averaging 1.5 mb.the problem device constantly disconnects internet forced wait re-connect. it's something everyone would notice (you watch going control panel ip address 192.168.1.1).there also really odd problems able update firmware mac, able initially turn device work ac power (i've always start unplugged it's connected attach power cord).i think really cheap product would avoid. it's probably near end-of-life much better (and faster) alternatives coming (see sprint 4g novatell).before buy - quick web search issues around model. found many wish i'd known made purchase.

 amend original review (see below) owning item several months. bought juice pack air october, despite others' complaints signal strength, sync working, fragile build quality, hadn't experienced trouble these, gave four stars early review.i've dropped problems. continuing, note least two revisions device there; know i've two different revisions.problem 1: original juice pack air, micro-usb connector broke two months. sad very, satisfied product moment. found one two people around web mention this, two months purchase, micro-usb connector case disappeared inside one evening went plug in, spelling doom case. determining couldn't easily open fix soldering iron something, put rma warranty service request via mophie website.service reasonably good. never got human call response, get ups tag. shipped broken case copy receipt using tag (so didn't pay shipping) now, two weeks later, new case arrived. thanks exchange mophie, worrying connector isn't attached substantial way (the replacement case same).problem 2: oddly, replacement case (supposedly exactly product) doesn't fit iphone 3gs nicely original case did. one full 2mm longer (yes, longer) meaning there's big empty gap (enough slide penny in) top phone top case. yes, top seated way. it's also nearly tight. know people complained tightness juice pack air, liked it. one still nicely made, it's much "slide on/slide easily" affair. case feels less though snugly protect phone.problem 3: replacement unit indeed kill signal strength (as others reported) way first unit didn't. wonder they've changed revisions causes this?problem 4: sync charge behavior frustratingly different new unit well. clearly highly different revisions piece equipment there. first juice pack air, sync worked transparently mophie attached (just plug computer saw it) charging easy, since left switch bottom "on" position time forgot it. plugging usb, juice pack iphone would charge full time. unplugging, juice pack would discharge first, iphone. now, charging sync behaviors different.first, sync longer works juice pack attached (a problem many others had). second, charging works like this:- plug juice pack (either switch position), actual iphone doesn't charge time (before, matter whether switch red green, iphone juice pack would charge parallel plugged in). now, plugged iphone continues discharge eventually go flat, even juice pack busily charges.- set switch green charge actual iphone, must unplug juice pack power charging occur (if it's plugged switch green, iphone charge). green red, moment plug juice pack back power, iphone stops charging, matter switch position. basically: charge juice pack plugged power (not iphone). charge iphone plugged power (and then, obviously, can't charge juice pack).getting full charge full flat thus requires following steps replacement unit:1. plug juice pack. wait charge (meanwhile, iphone goes dead stays dead).2. disconnect power, flip juice pack green. wait iphone charge (meanwhile, juice pack runs charges).3. reconnect juice pack, replace charge used (of course, plugged in, iphone stopped charging running juice pack charges).in short, it's literally impossible actually get full charge time unless take pack iphone charge separately. first juice pack air (the one broke replaced warranty) behave way.i suspect changed behavior complaints i've read overheating batteries charging time. didn't experience problem first juice pack, though get quite warm.in case, new review this: i'll continue use thing bought provide extra power. it's kind grudging acceptance frustration rather enthusiasm, i'm tempted try get ahold one competing (and discontinued, doubt due similar types problems) incase power slider units see they're better.maybe there's way right apple consider releasing "extended battery" version iphone that's twice thick $200 more? i'd pay gave double battery life without "power case" nonsense.----------------------------------------original review:so sitting apple store manhattan trying find single case protected sync port bottom iphone. couldn't find one. find mophie juice pack air less twice price basic black silicone cases sold store."not bad," thought, wanted read review see whether thing good, particularly since apple store didn't open one display least inspect build quality. reviews complained loss signal strength, much lower advertised battery power, and/or inability sync without removing iphone mophie.i contemplated, bought, knowing could always return hated it. immediately upon buying, went straight nearest horizontal surface, opened it, installed it. then, plugged usb port laptop.(1) signal strength degradation (knock wood).(2) computer found iphone happy syncing (knock wood).(3) later experience shown gives good 70% boost battery length (knock wood).apart that, think build quality complaints really baseless. beautifully finished, solid, nicely fitting (incredibly precise tolerances) piece equipment. complaining sound like they're removing case daily. warning: it's clearly designed removed replaced again, tell looking it. plan remove iphone time, case you. (and thus, plan use iphone kinds docks docking accessories, case you.)this thing clearly intended people good coverage areas use iphone mostly go, don't ready pile iphone accessories require docking, need nice cover boost operation time.the reasons give four stars rather five: idea long battery's lifetime be; lot lesser rechargeable batteries tend wear 20-30 cycles, haven't yet gotten mophie, also, micro usb cable comes damned short (like, foot half, literally) buy usb extension cable. make cable longer, guys. 
 *** april 23rd update: unfortunately power switch unit failed within 4 weeks (and light use) - switch gradually moved deeper inside unit one day separated completely rattled around inside case reduced review four one star. idea great build quality unit clearly substandard. confidence replacement fare better since seems design flaw - trying get money back mophie claim techngnet's problem solve (the original seller), techngnet claim mophie's problem. afraid advice buy case mophie unless willing flush seventy bucks drain.*** original review: little hesitant buy battery case based feedback, knew still needed something help 3gs busy day. disabled push used 3g sparingly order nurse phone whole day still ended low battery warnings 4pm days.i already seperate battery clumsy carry (plus cable) day charging night required organization capable of. researching alternatives decided mophie air best bunch available today, even though concerns possible drawbacks.i received mophie 2 weeks ago happy far. knew issues ahead time expectations set accordingly.what works:the form factor great - makes iphone chunky guess - actually feels better way easier hold use! materials seem ok, case doesn't feel cheap doesn't garish brand names emblazoned it, nice low key "mophie" imprinted logo. charge leds job. case snug fits 3gs ok covers whole phone back top. sure much protection really provides better nothing.battery capacity:not amazing recharge dead phone 90% enough long day (or two short ones).convenience:perfect - always ready need it. charging simple, plug night one cable morning fully charged phone case ready day. enable charging low juice flick small recessed switch phone charging back life, easy. syncing works fine microusb cable.drawbacks:cable - yes it's microusb means docks won't work unless slide case time - wasn't really bothered this. extra cables found online pretty cheaply.mute switch - can't unmute case on, need slide top get switch. irritating dealbreaker.reception - haven't noticed big drop signal strength others reported - might slight reduction nothing given trouble (yet?)microusb connector - people complained connector breaks inside phone continued use - haven't problems yet i'm keeping eye open this.price - it's pricy iphone primary tool you'll appreciate convenience investment worth it.best illustrations saved already -1) business call went much longer planned, battery 7% - flicked charger switch mid-call good go rest call (and day).2) writing review starbucks - 20% battery warning came don't care - it's time get mophie going.overall completely solved battery anxiety made iphone dependable device day - highly recommended.i confirmed blackberry micro usb data cables work fine mophie (they charge sync) purchased cheaply amazon. 
 wonder price low, battery pack bad iphone battery fully charged pack fully charged, cannot get even 5 hours use phonei noticed beginning returned item right away.the newtrent used outlast one far 
 bought originally outrageous price $90, thought would worth got full day heavy use iphone. first case worked 3 weeks stopped working (the case would hold charge, transfer charge iphone). returned (in box roomates, whose mophie also stopped working time) received new one, questions asked, nice. new one barely works all. extends life iphone battery hour two doesn't charge phone, doesn't seem work phone battery drops low. example, phone 20%, attach case would normally maybe 30 min talk time, mophie gets 60 minutes, phone dies, even though mophie power meter says juice left. disappointing product. 
 first, prepared loose signal. second case protect phone well. buyer beware! 
 file claim... fraudulent productchineese dungcan mophie suedcan mophie suedcan mophie suedcan mophie sued 
 mophie ashamed. case protect phone well loose signal battery case on. buyer beware! 
 used original mophie juice pack 3g. 6 9 months & wore wouldn't take charge. outer appearance deteriorated then, performed end. perfectly satisfied. got 3gs juice pac air came out, got one right away. 3 months & it's busted. cable problem got replaced website. today, connector case longer connects cable. tried new cable, old cable & wife's cables & nothing. lights, itunes, phone vibrating, nothing. it's 3 months. don't know it's design, build quality micro usb connector. (the mini usb connector fine & tested years don't know changed it)don't buy battery case. go back juice pack wait next generation. 
 bought run 3rd gen ipod touch. relatively comfortable, although would definitely prefer ear bud. problem ear buds run sweat makes slip out, good alternative. downside don't really get loud enough--the volume control kind limited. otherwise, need inexpensive, wireless headset work out, i'd recommend. you're looking great sound listening enjoyment, look elsewhere.update: return headphones; volume control stopped working altogether could never get music get external noise around me. skip these...there better products there! plan get sony ericsson bluetooth ear buds... 
 work great using buttons headphones feels like could fail given time. buttons work though i'm going judge think happen. i'll downgrade explain issue they're good bang buck beats getting tangled gym.dropped 4 3 stars short battery life foam keeps falling off.edit:don't know last edit didn't stick, stopped working 3 months occasional use. able return partial refund. steer clear! 
 headphones year static started coming left ear piece. loud painful. even turned keeps making static. nothing i've tried rectified it. guess it's time new pair headphones, won't motorola. 
 i've two pair now. work perfect me, months stopped working. mainly use riding bike, maybe sweat problem. first set stopped working, thought something. second set stopped manner. 
 problem 1 - bought details said would pair 2 devices time. followed directions paired iphone 4s turned off, turned headphones back paired ipad 2. turned everything off. turned iphone ipad back finally headphones would connect 1 device. wanted able watch videos ipad still answer phone these. could that.problem 2 - happend decided try iphone listen music, music sounded fine made phone calls echo person end told sounded terrible. tried restarting everything still problem.problem 3 - wearing 2 hours ears killing me, uncomfortable!needless say returned day got them. 
 really bad battery life, connection lost often liked. buy thing again. what's more, i'm sure buy bluetooth headsets again. 
 purchased headphones really hard corded kind, find needing replace every year two. bluetooth headset seemed like way go. unfortunately, turn case. sound quality decent, charge time okay, sadly, thing cannot maintain bluetooth connection iphone. every minutes, connection weakens, sound stutters even cuts seconds. given keep phone shirt pocket, distance phone headphones less 2 feet, yet connection fails. i'd call reliable product. would definitely buy again. total waste money. 
 months stopped accepting charge. sound quality good expected last longer 
 cheap plastic band goes behind head huge sticks like wing behind neck. look up, hits neck moves heaphones. band adjustable - big design flaw.also, max volume level horrible - easily hear noise around turned way up. 
 bad choice want get music.bad choice want use sony bluetooth supporting phone (like sony walkman series. latest phone)i understand dont expect good bose 30 bucks, jwin comes price, gives better quality.i think motorola never good music earphones thing.with sony phone (& sometime iphone too), quality bad.sound like interrupted every seconds.come on, 2010. bluetooth magic, work !! 
 need average cranium, sound super, microphone tinny people hard time hearing me. go long way phone retain connection though! 
 liked everything headset. wore gym worked sweat. everything fine finished workout tried turn off. nothing happened - held power button kept blinking. let run power (and dry out) charged again. worked fine 30 minutes. worked sweat, started cutting finally made buzzing noise wouldn't turn off. let dry worked fine two days. went back gym sure enough, worked sweat started cutting started buzzing. got fed stomped threw remains nearest trash can. wish sent back refund, lost temper.in case, excellent stopped working properly. 
 bought headphones january 2012. worked well couple month started bad times return window closed. automatically disconnected phone without reason. worked well skype sometimes. need connect headphone start skype app iphone log-in. (you need follow order). it'll work first call make. want hang make another skype call, disconnect headset, log skype follow steps again. finally, + volume controller stopped working. couldn't use anymore. bad! 
 used month running, ran 50 miles. sweat light mist month (never run rain) caused go out. don't buy expectation even somewhat rugged. don't know else somebody would use exercising... 
 reading good reviews amazon, finally decided buy headphone itouch (with latest 3.1.2 firmware) wanted wireless headphone freedom offers. got day ordering using amazon's prime shipping. charged headphone completely (until green light came) also paired easily ipod also laptop. soon hearing experience, started getting pauses listening itouch. audio lagged many times even full charge disgusted returning back product. also ear fit uncomfortable doubt anyone wear product 30 mins more. all, poor product disappointed me. 
 disappointed. item work right retail box. charge light came red never changed green. headphones would power on. looking forward these. processed refund (and grateful amazon process). reorder see reviewers, somebody know bought headphones, overall product quality poor experience uncommon. 
 motorola s305 surprisingly sound good kinivo bth220 (also sold names). kinivo also consistently easier time connecting iphone. however, motorola s305 looks feels better kinivo, appears durable.i would given s305 4 stars, three months ownership, + volume button completely broken. - button works fine. experienced similar problem another motorola model, problem took year manifest. no, drop abuse headphones. hardly even used volume buttons since controlling volume phone usually sufficient.these headphones going trash. 
 excited opening package. reading directions, plugged unit charge, waited, waited, waited. unit never charged. sent back. gave one star - bad quality control - disappointed. 
 head set band twists back ear cups separate away ears. band also goes behind ears presses back ears uncomfortable. one may molded really bad. keeps disconnecting phone phone 2 feet away. keep shopping around. 
 poor battery life... it's supposed extended high capacity battery life battery like regular battery came phone, sucks. buy!!how send battery back !!!!!!!! 
 used device successfully two weeks prongs broke end attaches phone. unfortunately, couple days passed "return" period luck. buyer beware! thankfully, $5. 
 supposed auto shut-off phone reaches full charge. plugged night, phone showed charging, went bed. next morning, phone dead. lost 30% charge overnight, charging. next night plug charger, doesn't work! total garbage. bought two them, less! maybe one work? i'm holding breath. 
 tool job original sim card tray tool apple. cheap cutout. buy want original one apple. don't care scratch aluminum coating phone inserting tool phone buy it. want keep phone pristine beautiful condition, don't waste time cheap product. 
 pin super fragile! forget metal all. entered sim card area remove sim card tray thing snapped! it's complete waste money time! 
 iphone pin recived bent up.when got pin hanging outside package.the package open many holes it. 
 lg env touch awful phone. accessories work it's awful phone, everything goes deserves one star rating.
