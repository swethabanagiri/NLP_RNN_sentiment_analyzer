 worried bad reviews, however said re-desighned took chance, first one received large crack it, packaged ended returning ordering again, next one came box good. pleased this, ordered one price style different brand two like one better.- thin slim style ad bulk it- brand same-the belt clip much stronger looking brand, say need super strong clip may you, stronger brand ordered-one feature one clip one side case stand one don't want holster part use stand want pushed don't to, brand built holster clip scince phone faces seems kinda useless me. strong is?? problem would carefull. also otter box, say like one much better don't need super strong thick bulky type case, like switch cases colors suit mood, need. kind use love take gym clip shirt pants whatever problam want use stand playing works good, make higher end looking one got, like prefer one, said need super strong case may protection purse car basic use case good. buy again. 
 may everyone, like it. case solid. screen well protected leaving ample openings on/off, volume, camera, speaker, pen, earphone, microusb port. heeding warning users beltclip breaks readily, intentionally broke :) put rest holder/phone cargo pants. real fast getting phone out, bluetooth ubiquitous days, there's less need speed. built-in stand little unstable 'portrait' position, works fine 'landscape' position. also works well dash (gps) holder: i.trek me-usdm universal dashboard mount, also amazon. 
 i've found far best method clipping phone belt, i've used others many expensive always come back one built kickstand ability easily quickly slide phone out.they're cheap yes i've never problems durability except long time use, much longer would expect cheap piece plastic last, ones kickstands like locking mechanism eventually wears whole thing easily replaceable.i times knocked phone holster bumping something tradeoff pay lock obstructing access device.

 well build carrying case last while.it eye catcher design allows phone breath get heated like cases.the belt clip build well,very solid also turns 360 degree positioned direction.this exact fit note 2 worth time. 
 going purchase phone, knew would need holster use practically. previous phone, droid 3, also holster, liked much. never grew fond idea putting phone pocket.i bought holster 4/26/13 and, despite many negative reviews, pretty sure bought new improved design. i've holster little 2 months time writing it's holding well. kickstand strong, feel weak flimsy, placing gn2 inside case, snaps firmly. in, would need like plastic pry tool get again, placing gn2 holster, fits fine.so far, dis-colorization (i white edition match housing gn2), criss-cross pattern isn't fading away, belt clip strong sturdy. use belt clip everyday hints anything telling it's going break time soon. belt clip place, stays there.as stated throughout review, don't see abnormalities product. managed break myself, would buy replacement. 
 fit function great. kickstand big plus. form tight cut outs neat.

 bought artic red frost nexus 4. love material case makes strong hold phone (hard rubber-type material) case also covers parts bezel-- enough damage screen laid screen. cut-outs aligned perfectly. two cons hard press power button & doesn't good grip. although ease press volume buttons, apply pressure power button. maybe mistake creating. week, kind got used it, bother much always notice it. somewhat slippery back, sorta makes hold slippery. speaking back, back makes phone looks awesome. transparent clearly read 'nexus' & 'lg' back. gives phone good look. grip, severe issue, level grip less case greatshield. want put consumers consider. another thing i'll add looks pretty cool sunlight. see part actual phone case sunlight makes mostly edges case glisten. conclude, sticking case look, protection, decent grip. 
 it's slip case looks good protects phone light drops onto desk. thick enough keep lens glass display glass touching laying phone down. also love diamond patterned grips sides phone - makes grabbing run real easy, slipping. money, it's good buy you're looking keep phone pocket without adding lot bulk.

 mix smooth ridged surfaces nice touch aesthetically also helps keep nice grip smooth bit slippery. case fits like glove holes cuts outs fit various ports perfectly. price item hard beat arrived quickly. haven't tried fun nfc features yet, i'm anticipating problems.all all, you're looking nice, simple bumper case suggest look (assuming price still good). 
 fits like glove. adds bulk phone - gs4 stays slim light!the kickstand works, doesn't slide around, nice firm. clicks shut two tiny tabs plastic either end kickstand, guess time tabs break won't stay shut anymore. moment, tabs really tiny hopefully break anytime soon.the downsides find are:a. hard feel whether pressed power/volume button not, there's tactile feedback push. work though.b. screw(?) holds kickstand place back case bulges makes phone sit slightly lopsided put flat surface facing upward. issue me, didn't expect screw bulge way does.otherwise satisfied.

 pros fits tighly, provides great protection dropping phone. also covers power button firmly, great without case phone would turn pocket times. seems like well made case, would surporised manufacturer sold case another name much higher pricecons. none far 
 fits great looks good. like fact doesn't add much thickness phone, adds grip. 
 nothing flashy case. it's basic black, good thing is, it's matte backside. around edges it's shiny, makes grippy. like volume on/off buttons covered keep dust out, covering make buttons harder push. cutouts good, quite perfect, you'd ocd notice. seems secure, probably would come phone inadvertently.btw, blackout case completely opaque. blue arctic frost crystal slip case identical blue transparent.right now, different prices listed these. me, actual cost shipping around $3, it's definitely worth that. 
 use case phone everyday. bought otterbox first ended returning it. like bulked phone. case slim sleek looks great black s4. sure would buy white phone. also provided little grip easily slides pocket. highly recommend case. provides protection looks great. 
 basic rubber case job. fits well slides pocket easly phone rocks too.
