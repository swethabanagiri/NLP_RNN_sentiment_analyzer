Before I was using the Mophie case but I couldn't wear it often because it was like having a hot brick in your pocket, Hence I had to always leave it at home.On the contrary, with PowerBear, I never take it off because I can't even tell the difference. Also it is build in a super STRONG manner and even though I dropped my phone a few times, its shock resistant technology won't let a single thing happen to the case or the phone. The PowerBear case became an extension to my phone that I never have to take off because when I charge it at night, it charges both my phone and the case, and I have battery life for more than two days. I was also shocked to hear all the positive compliments I was hearing from people at my job, fitness center, and throughout the community. Everybody was loving the case, and what they don't know is that it cost  me 60 % CHEAPER then all the other brand.

I bought 15 of them, because they are so cheap and because they actually do seem to provide high current.No idea how long they last. I assume they will work fine. I have not been using them much.

Who knows how accurate that is, but if yo're taking it at face value, I find certain comfort knowing that my battery hasn't been sitting on the shelf losing it's potential usefulness in holding a charge for my crushing of candies.After successfully opening my phone, I can confirm that all the labeling and signage match exactly to what is on the original battery in my phone. Any copycat can do this, but it gives me hope that this new battery comes from the same manufacturers as the OEM battery.The tools worked just fine for me. I was able to pry the top glass of my phone off by using the tools provided in the kit. Do some extra research around properly removing the battery.

Until lately, my car tape player kept rejecting it out. I thought it was broken and I was about to buy this same product from Amaonz again. While reading some other people\'s reviews, I bump into R. Penny\'s feedback on 10/26/05 about the 'skip' mode as following:'One thing to keep in mind when using any product like this - some (but not all) car tape players have a 'skip' mode. When a tape player\'s 'skip' mode is active, it listens for silent portions of the tape. If it is detects any silence for more than a few seconds, it will automatically go into fast forward until it 'hears' sound again. If your tape player has a 'skip' mode, be sure to cancel this mode - i.e., put the player in 'normal' play mode. Otherwise, you will find the tape player trying to 'fast forward' over any silent portions of your audio feed.'This is exactly the problem that I was having. By turning off the 'skip' mode of the car tape player, my car tape player does not reject the Coby Cassette Adapter anymore.Again, even if it is indeed broken, I will buy the same product again. Very good product for the money.'], ['I bought this cassette adapter to replace my old one who's cord got ripped in half when stuck in my door. I get better sound out of this one than I did from my other one that I originally bought for more than twice the price.The best part of this cassette adapter is that the cord is coiled, and can be stretched to be super long (probably at least 8 feet although I have not checked) yet when no tension is applied (during normal use or storage) the cord is only about 3 feet long. This keeps it from getting stuck in things like car doors or wrapped around steering wheels or getting all tangled which my old adapter did.I am very pleasantly surprised at this adapter.

The plug is the stretchy spiral type so it doesn\'t hang around getting tangled on my feet while I\'m driving.  It was way better than that last stupid cheap one I bought at best buy that the cord wore out on after 2 months.  The sound quality is really not bad once you learn how to adjust the volumes properly. Everything you should expect from a cassette adapter.In order to get the volumes adjusted for optimal sound quality (without that white noise the tape players give off), adjust your phone or other mobile music device to 75% volume and keep it there while plugged in.  From this point just use your car\'s volume to amplify the volume.Good luck!'], ['I have a cassette player in my car and wanted to be able to plug my MP3 player into it.

If yo're paying 300 for it, you aren't getting a good deal.Clear reception, included ear piece is more comfortable than the generics that come with a phone like the R225 Samsung.Great display.

The pictures come out real clear and beautiful after you send it via Email. Please don't judge the quality of the pictures by what you see on the T610. I admit that the pictures look a little fuzzy on the T610. But with only 2MB of memory the purpose of taking pictures is to upload them or send them via Email to others. The quality of the pictures improves dramatically once they are sent and viewed via one's PC.2) The Bluetooth features on this phone are outrageous. I have paired my SE T610 using T-Mobile's unlimited VPN GPRS Data Service with my Palm Zire 72, HP IPAQ 4155, and Logitech Mobile Wireless Bluetooth Headset and Performance is Great. If you got a Bluetooth enabled Palm or Pocket PC, then this is the phone for you. Sony Ericsson was in on the ground floor on this Bluetooth Revolution. I send data via my Pocket PC and Palm to my SE T610 via Bluetooth in a flash. Moreover, web surfing is much faster than I thought via Bluetooth.3) I have absolutely NO problem with signal strength or clarity of voice calls in NYC where I primarily use this phone. Where I go in the boroughs of Queens, Bronx, Manhatten, Brooklyn and Nassau County (with the exception of Garden City) is great.People need to realize that T-Mobile does not have the extensive network that Verizon or even Sprint has. So, if you are looking to buy this phone to use with the T-Mobile Network, I can enthusiastically recommend it if you live in most of NYC (outside of Staten Island). However, you need to do your own due diligence and check out in advance whether this phone will perform well with your service provider in the area where you live.'], ['I've had my T610 + Tmobile for about a month now (So no word on the rebates yet) but as for the phone and service... I've been pretty satisfied.  I get pretty good reception everywhere... The phone is small and comfortable and everything seems to work on it without a hitch.  The camera is good enough for a cell phone... and the phone was more pleasing after I got a few new games/themes/ringtones on it via the infrared port.  The phone doesn't have all that much memory but I deleted all the predefined themes/songs/graphics (or at least all the ones it lets you), and that gave me more than enough.  It hasn't frozen on me yet (and mine came with the oldest firmware).  I heard upgrading the firmware resolves freezing issues, increases the quality/compression of the pictures, and overall makes the phone more useable... but I none of these things have affected me like others, so I haven't looked into how to upgrade it.  Unfortunately, you cant just update the firmware yourself...  Two of my friends also have the same package and are pretty happy with it.  I think most the reviews on here are just people who've had negative experiences...'], ['Good product. Quick shipment was provided by the vendor and item was exactly as described. I am Very satisfied with this purchase'], ['This is an excellent replacement battery, it fit just fine and the price was amazing.

My phone does not have problem with power with this battery and me neither.'], ['If I'd bought this battery where I bought the cell phone, it would've cost much, much more.  I didn't need a new phone - just a new battery - so instead of adding another used cell phone to the trash heap, I've recycled a used battery and kept the phone I really like!  The phone now works like new!'], ['I bought this to try and repair a POS dash cam, even though this battery is great it was not the issue... It fit perfectly and accepted charge as it should.'], ['Works great. I've been using this for over a year, seems to hold charge good as OEM (it is OEM)'], ['I love the compact design and fit of the ear rest. You can barely tell you are wearing this thing.

It lasts forever! I only bought it for Xbox live but it works great with cell phones too. It says its made by plantronics in the description but the headset itself says verizon on the side so I'm not sure what the deal is with that but I know that it works great. So if yo're looking for a nice regular headset for xbox live because the microsoft headsets break all the time or for a cell phone, buy this headset. I went ahead and bought another one before they're sold out. Try to buy from OEM planet if they got it in stock, they are the best in my opinion.'], ['I don't know, I've always liked high-tech and loved the idea of bluetooth, even though it tends to make one look like a space alien contacting the mother ship or a blathering fool until someone notices the bluetooth unit in your ear.But I've never gotten good reception with bluetooth units or enough batter life. Don't get me started on static and wind noise.That's why for the money you can't do better than these wired units. They're lightweight, comfortable, and have ample cord length. I've ordered several, and yo'd pay 3 times the price in a bog-box electronics store. Do yourself a favor, even if you do own a bluetooth, keep one of these one hand. Well worth the price.'], ['It's perfect for those of us who don't have smartphones or a headphone jack. Sound quality is excellent and it makes multitasking so much easier.

I ordered 3.'], ['I purchased one of these headsets many years ago and was very happy with it.  Well, my husband tried it and decided he needed it since he did a lot of driving for work.  I was very happy to see that these were still available and at a much better price than what I paid way back.I love that I can use these with my cordless phones as well as my cell phone.  I prefer the corded sets, they just seem to have a better sound quality.  I love that this earpiece fits snuggly around your lobe.  I wear glasses and this works out great.  I go between this style and one that wraps around my head, it just depends on which handset I pick up.  Highly recommend to anyone who prefers the corded headset.'], ['I've bought about 20 of these things by now, and shared them with many friends & family, who rave about them.  It's comfortable and fits in your ear, and the sound quality (especially the noise cancellation on the mic) is *stellar* - you can be driving down a noisy freeway and the person listening to you will *never* know yo're in the car.I tried several Bluetooth headsets and was thoroughly unimpressed: you have to charge them, they add latency, they add extra compression artifacts, and the audio clips in and out on you.This headset has the disadvantage of having a wire, but it's also about 1/20th the price of a Bluetooth headset, and won't give you cancer.  (Ever since I got a large benign osteoma in my skull after, suspiciously, 6 months of very heavy cell phone use, I'm a bit paranoid about cell phone radiation).The jack is the smaller size (2.5 mm), which is unfortunate, as most smartphones these days are 3.5mm (so you can plug in a headset or just headphones).  So, once I got a smartphone, I ended up buying half a dozen adapters, because I love this headset so much.'], ['The ony draw back to this product is that it is corded.

This works well by being clipped to my ear and I can use it to chat hands free.'], ['Like most people I have owned multiple styles of headsets and had varying degrees of success with them.  This Plantronics CS50 is simply the best unit I have ever used.  The unit worked my desktop phone answering system in my office.  I was on the phone every day and for 6 hours or more on a rough day.I got tired of holding a phone to my ear in the office for hours and being 50 feet away from my desk and missing the important call I was waiting for. This device solved both problems.  The headset unit gives you call answer and end control with your fingertips as well as volume and mute control.  It gave me remote ring detection and allowed me to be up to 300 feet away from my desk and catch that important call.  It would operate for up to 8 hours but it has a desktop control stand that charged the headset while I am in a meeting or at lunch.I used the Plantronics HL 10 Handset Lifter and by touching the button on the headset I could answer the phone remotely with ease.  The sound going both ways was excellent and I never had an issue with the unit.  Other designs I had tried were not always clear and people would complain that they could not hear me.  Not with this unit.  The noise cancelling mike and the cushioned ear piece made for excellent communication and comfortable wearing for long hours during the day.The unit has a fast recharge time in about 3 hours for 100 % full charge from empty.  The headset is extremely light and comfortable and the phone transmission is digitally encrypted for security and privacy.  This is the first tool I would buy if I were setting up a new office today.  It is great!'], ['Very clear transmission of calls both incoming and outgoing.  Easy integration with current phone system. I would buy again if needed.'], ['Mine died and I needed a new one. Works perfect just like my old one.

Keeps everything safe, secure and dry.'], ['..and I'm from Europe, where the phones and networks are much better than in the States. I have to say that I think Samsung currently have the best software (and I used to be a huge Nokia fan). Amazingly light, very intuitive, great audio, and just looks great. I recommend this without any reservations whatsoever.'], ['And it was pretty much worth it (if you sign the plan and get the phone for $250). Otherwise it is a little pricey. The gain was enough to make me feel good about buying it though, and my plan was up anyway so no remorse there.

And of course GPS is nize.'], ['I've glanced at a few reviews and looked at the overall review for this phone, and think it's a little underrated.  I've had a couple weeks to try out mine, and the battery life with my usage is 3-4 days, and I use the phone for short calls about 5 times a day.  The phone doesn't squeak when squeezed, and all of the construction is tight (even the flip screen doesn't wiggle much).  I saw a few complaints about the weight of the phone, and even a complaint about the metal battery panel.  It's called quality, sometimes quality weighs a little, and if the phone makes your pants fall down when it's hooked onto your jeans, buy a belt.  The phone employs java applications, so you can download programs to fit your needs from nextel, at a cost.  You can also get them from third party sites, also ringtones, wallpaper, etc.  The phone uses GPS, can locate your approximate position for free, with software it can give you directions from one location to another for free (navigational software), called telenav.  The quality of the speakers and microphones on this phone is great.  The speakers can be loud enough to hear in different rooms of the house, or quiet enough you can barely hear them.  The sound is crisp, even on direct connect.  Also, an answer to the slams against nextel itself, don't listen to it.  The only problem is their tech support does not operate 24/7,  other than that their customer service is as good as any service based organization I've ever worked with.  This phone is full featured, it isn't exactly a PDA phone, but it's software capability and 65k color screen make it perform many of the same functions as a PDA.  Great phone, if nextel services your area, you won't be disappointed.'], ['Other than the high initial cost (I got it before they put in a promotion, duh), i really love this compact and stylish phone.  It's the best Nextel has offered yet, although there's rumor that a camera phone is coming out soon.  If you can wait, wait a bit longer, otherwise for walkie-talkie style cellular, Nextel is the best.  No delays like with Verizon (up to 30 seconds!) or Sprint (10 secs).  Walkie-talkie that actually works where there's coverage.  I'm a happy customer.'], ['I have to say that this is a great phone and the Nextel service is great also.As for the review from the moron from Denver You need to have used it and the service before you open your mouth and make a fool of your self.People that review something and not have a clue just goes to show that stupid people should not breed.I have had the I90c,I95cl and the i730 and the 730 is great as for a alarm buy a clock if you need a alarm.The screen is a little smaller but the brilliant color makes up for it,the sound is as good as the other phones I have had.As for service I have had every carrier that is in the state of Colorado and Nextel is the best and for any one who is thinking of Verizon for push to talk well it sould be push to wait.If you want the best this phone and service is the best.'], ['First a quick confession: I do not like T-Mobile.  I had them before and hated their (lack of) coverage and bad service.That said, the v300 is a very good phone.  I won't rehash the long feature list here.  What I really like (after playing with a friend's) is the loud ringtones, the good reception (despite the lack of GSM coverage in Brooklyn), and the great styling.  This phone is not made by Motorola per se but by their Asian partner, maybe that explains the &quot;girlish&quot; styling, but it's still pretty cool.  Of course, the light weight and good battery life make it a stand-out.My favorite phone is still the Sanyo VM-4500 video camera walkie-talkie speakerphone cell phone for Sprint PCS...'], ['I recently used two of the plug on a trip.

There are two different Europe plugs, I took them both, and they both worked everywhere I went.I used the adapters primarily in Denmark and Norway, they worked great and gave me no problems charging iPod, iPhone, iPad, camera batteries, etc.Note that there are numbers on the plugs, the numbers correspond to the cardboard insert to let you know where to use the plugs. It would be better if the plugs themselves had that information on them, but at least they have the numbers (which I didn't see at first so I put my own numbers on them).I will undoubtedly keep using the adapters on future trips, and I'll keep this updated.Update:Have also now used in Thailand, worked great.'], ['Works as it is supposed to, lightweight, compact, and very economical.

But a lot of small electrical appliances are only made to work with AC power, and for those devices, a 12-volt in-vehicle power inverter is the answer. I have bought dedicated power adapters for laptop computers, but these are expensive and usually only work with a particular model laptop. I tried the Sabrent 75-watt inverter in my Subaru, and it worked fine for providing both AC and USB power. I used it with two of my AC-powered camera battery chargers and a AA battery charger:Canon G10 battery charger - 14 wattsNikon D3200 battery charger - 20 wattsMaha AA battery charger - 16 wattsI also used the inverter to charge my HP laptop while using the laptop. The laptop uses a maximum of 50 watts while running, which is well below the inverter's limits. While using the inverter for AC devices, I also recharged my Android smartphone with the 1A USB charging port.One caution: Every vehicle's electrical system has a maximum rated power that it can deliver through the vehicle's power port. For my Subaru Forester, the owner's manual says this is 120 watts. Trying to power a device or devices that exceed that limit will likely blow a fuse. I should also note that Subaru sells its own 100-watt power inverter for my vehicle, but it costs about $300, while the Sabrent inverter is a small fraction of that amount.For anyone who has a need for AC power in their vehicle, the Sabrent inverter is a good option to consider. The inverter is also available in 150 watts (Sabrent 150w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C15U)) and 300 watts (Sabrent 300w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C30U)).A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.'], ['I\'m standing in a room with a TV blasting, just 10 feet away.

It comes with a the headset, a medium length cord with 2.5mm plug, a small and large windscreen, and a 2.5mm-line in/ line out adapter for your PC and a carry case, plus 3 different sized earplugs and a cleaning tool. I use it for 4-5 hrs per day on averagePros:Very high quality speaker. Like high quality headphones, if you phone has good signal it sounds great, but yo'll hear lots of distortion with a poor signal. I use it with a blackberry 9650 and a femtocell - it is sounds as good as a high quality landline. It didn't sound as good with HTC and Samsung (CDMA) phones, but this is indicative of the quality of the phone's voice circuitry.Great noise cancelling microphone - with the windscreen on, you can use it outdoors even in strong wind (20 mph). Background noise is very muted and callers are usually amazed that I am on a cell.Works with glasses and hats - unit is held in place by friction. It's light enough so it works well. This makes it great for outdoor activities.Cord is perfect length and is designed to work with the phone on a belt clip or pants pocket. Form factor is great and it takes little space.Surprisingly, friction alone holds the unit in place. It is pretty durable too (sitting on it or dropping it)Cheap - for $35, it performs much better than the Jawbone/Plantronics bluetooth variety without the radiation risk and outperforms high end corded headsets too (call center sets, theBoom)Cons:2.5mm plug.

This is it.On my motorcycle you can\'t hear the engine, and with the windscreen it is good at low speeds (sans windshield - at 30 mph the smaller windscreen starts letting noise through.  You can\'t hear my stereo blaring.  I would say it is just slightly less able than the BlueParrot - but that might be because the boom doesn\'t quite reach the corner of my mouth.  But I only have problems if the noise is coming in at just the right angle.It has an isolating insert so it blocks out external noise (you might need an earplug for the other ear in really noisy environments).A few nits:They should have cases for the windscreens - they tend to get squished.  A stereo or dual mono version would be welcome.  The boom could be a bit longer.Only negative is they don\'t include an iPod/Blackberry/(some)Android 4 conductor 3.5mm adapter, but I already have several.

Without a hub, I wouldn't have enough USB ports to plug everything in!Over the past several years, I've gotten a number of USB hubs to handle the problem.  I bought a 7-port CyberPower Hub from another vendor to use at work.  It's lasted with day in and day out use for about two years.  One heavy use is that I use a password manager on a USB thumbdrive and it gets plugged in at least twice a day.  The CyberPower hub at work doesn't seem to mind.The hubs at home, and even the USB ports on my motherboards, seem to loosen up and not keep a good grip on the USB thumbdrive.  So, when my home hub flaked out again, I decided to get a hub that I know works, and keeps on working, for use at home.The only drawback to the hub is the LED's on it.  They are a little too bright, and not really all that useful.  However, it's not a problem at work, and at home, the hub is hidden behind a monitor.  I wouldn't want to use it in a bedroom.If yo're looking for a reliable hub, this is it.'], ['I bought this one based on all the good user reviews and its popularity.

Works like a charm!I did find the glow light annoying, but it's easy enough to unplug the hub when I finish working in the evening, so it's not a big issue for me.I'm a happy camper now, and I whole-heartedly recommend this hub for those who need more ports in a small space.  I should also commend Amazon for super-fast delivery.  Problem solved!P.S.  Mikey is my cat.  He likes this hub and shows it by periodically knocking it off my desk.I would prefer that Mikey didn't like it!'], ['This is an excelent USB port it has the option for it's power . Ether pluged in an A/C outlet or power from your device's nice option'], ['This is a great hub and has been good for several months. Highly recommend and will buy it again for additional needs.'], ['[Apart from minor issues like stability of the 'weighted' base, this hub has been such a consistent, heavy-duty performer, while holding its price point (just short of 30) for exactly 4 years, that I\'ve had to award it 5 stars (and order the identical model for my wife).  But just in the last 2 months the hub has been behaving completely opposite to expectations.  It goes totally dead with my hard drives, telling me that they\'re drawing too much power and therefore the hub is shutting them down until I remove them. But even when the hub is naked with the exception of a tiny flash drive, it remains dead, dark and non-communicative.  It comes back to life only when I disconnect the AC power and rely on nothing more than the power supplied by the USB ports.  That\'s fine, but not what I need with my 1TB (and bigger) hard drives, which until now had been showing on my computer\'s desktop with each start-up.  I\'m about to call a rep in order to get an idea of what\'s going on and whether there\'s a fix (could it be Apple\'s latest update to OSX?  I\'ll be back pending further info.]I realized I needed a 7-port hub and checked out the D-Link, Kensington, Belkin--the usual suspects.  Then I chanced upon this unlikely contender, looking more like a jukebox in Amazon\'s picture than a hub.  I was intrigued by the off-beat design and noticed that the price was competitive (though a couple of the others are presently offering rebates, a free flylight, and other sweeteners). Now that I\'m looking at the CyberPower USB port 'in person,' I can provide a few initial impressions:1.  It\'s a lot smaller than the picture might imply.  Compactness is nice, but you also want a hub that will stay put and that allows sufficient space between adjacent plugs.2.  Although the hub is designed for either vertical or horizontal use, the added and welcome weight of the detachable base makes vertical use the more sensible option.  Otherwise, you\'ve got a lightweight (and fairly generic) loaded-up plug which could easily move around, dislodging the USB mini-plug (a necessary evil except for small cameras) at one end of every USB 2.0 cable.3.  It seems to handle my equipment off of the USB power supplied by the computer, but I still breathe easier using the included AC power adapter. (To the manufacturer\'s credit, it\'s one of the slimmer, lighter wall-warts that I\'ve seen.)4.  The flash drive mount is practical (but not unique).  Now I can finally use that old Sandisk thumb drive that formerly was taking up the space of two USB ports.5.  The individual port lights are on all the time and, unlike most hubs, are not indicative of the presence or absence of a USB device.In conclusion, it\'s a reliable performer and a convenient as well as eye-catching device--providing you go for the vertical look.  If I were to suggest one design improvement, it would be to 'fatten up' the tower so that it would be wide enough to permit horizontal insertion of USB devices with the hub in vertical position.  Doing so would assure unforced accommodation of all your USB plugs, even the most space-devouring ones.  Biggest 'gripe': the vertical design is not real stable.  The hub is easily dislodged from the base and bounces around quite a bit.  If I had to do it over, I\'d look at the heavy, dome-shaped Kensington.[Revaluation after almost 3 years: I tried the Kensington. It was no more stable but less reliable. So I returned to the CyberPower, but without the base or vertical position.  I velcroed its back side to the wooden surface behind my desktop machine, with printer and two 500GB storage drives inputted to the rear, one USB cable from the front side to the USB of my iMac, and a flash drive connected to the top side of the hub.  Absolutely no problems.  This item continues to rise in both popularity and price because it\'s so good.  Should it ever fail, I doubt there\'s any other hub available that could surpass it. Forget the 'cuteness' factor; this thing is all business.][4 years later: This 'off brand' hub continues to be an Amazon best-seller while hubs like the Kensington 'round mound' have fallen off the map, so this one is a proven winner.  Only lately I\'ve had some difficulty with getting it to recognize really large (1TB) hard drives. Before condemning the drive, I going to try some different cables and maybe a call to the manufacturer.  Otherwise, the next step up would be either a 3.0 USB hub or a hub with dedicated switches, permitting you to assign just the power-draining devices to the AC-powered inputs while allowing the other devices (iPods, mouse receivers, flash drives, printers, etc.) to run sheerly on USB power.]'], ['My my newLogitech G11 Gaming Keyboard (Black/Silver)did not work when I plugged it onto myD-Link DUB-H4 High Speed USB 2.0 4-Port Hub.

I purchased as a replacement USB hub for use on my laptop and very much like that you can tuck it anywhere easily. Great quality product.'], ['Its been 11 months now that I've held on to my Nokia 6600 for. I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available. I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time. I must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held. It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.Now I'm a techy and like getting technical about things so I'd brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer. My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610. I think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important thing for me as Im constantly sending messages , calling people and fiddling around with my phone. Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad2. The looks are absolutely no nonsensical. Some complain it being a tad too bulky looking. I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface. There's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed. The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature. I upgraded mine to a 128 MB MMC Card via which I can store unlimited number of messages, take a thousand pictures and videos. Capacity is not a problem here.4. The Build is just right. The phone is sturdy. I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever. Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it. This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome. I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth. The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary. The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phoneBesides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality. It has great upgradibility. I can play MP3 files on my phone by simply downloading softwares freely available on the net. Now that is neat. The log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways.The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving. I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.Anyhow some demerits of this phone,The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use. Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds. You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone. When I purchased this phone , I thought to myself that I had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought didn't please me. In any case , putting aside how common it is in my city , I dont think I can be anymore satisfied. This makes for a great phone.Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?gee anyways ENJOY WHAT WORKS!'], ['For the money these are great.

Since then, I have not had one problem with it except when I forget to change the batteries!I have been able to successfully pair and use this keyboard with originally a Samsung I760, then a HTC Touch Pro 2 and now my Motorola Xoom tablet.  I was surprised that I didn't even have to download drivers, it worked once I simply paired it.Not having number dedicated keys was a sacrifice but I can type memos, emails or simply work on a novel at anytime conveniently by having this portable keyboard.  The keyboard itself is very durable and has a sturdy feel when you are typing.'], ['I have infrared (IR) keyboards to use with my Palm Treo 650 and Palm TX. They don\'t work very well, at least not for me. I had major problems with lag: characters I typed simply didn\'t make it to the screen.Taking a chance, I bought the Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard . . . and I am very, very impressed.Set-up is very quick and Stowaway\'s set-up software is simple to use. Reading the short user\'s manual (not the brief Quick Start) is a must. The learning curve isn\'t steep, but because the keyboard is intended as a 'universal' device, tweaks have to be made for using it with Palm or Pocket PC devices.Once set up, the keyboard performs superbly well. Every key I struck showed up immediately onscreen. I have large hands and I was concerned that I would encounter many typos because of my large fingers. I needn\'t have worried. The keys have a firm touch and the spacing is wide enough to keep typos to a miniumum. Because of the immediate feedback provided by Bluetooth, I felt no tendency to go back and retype because the character didn\'t show up. I had no idea that the IR keyboard with its lag was causing me to do that so much.Others have commented about instability because the ends of the keyboard are essentially unsupported. At first this struck me as a design flaw, but within a few minutes this is easily compensated for. I had little difficulty with my keystrokes causing the keyboard to rock.Some have also complained about devices slipping off the minimal stand provided. I had no problems with the Treo 650 or Palm TX.Finally a number of people have complained that there is no fifth row for entry of numbers. You have to use a function key + number combination or you can set the keyboard to number lock. If you have to enter a lot of numeric data, the complaints are justified. On the other hand, for people like me who have limited need for numeric entry, it is an inconvenience, but not a major one. I\'m happy to trade a fifth row for numerics for the small size of the unit.Construction of the unit is typical for many of today\'s products. It\'s plastic with some metal, but overall it does not feel like it is built like a tank. On the other hand, it doesn\'t feel overy flimsy either. Time and use will tell how well the unit stands up.Overall, this unit makes it eminently possible to use handheld devices like the Treo 650 and Palm TX for serious typing. I was surprised to find that I could type almost as rapidly on this keyboard as I can on a full-sized unit. The Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard is a very slick piece of work and well worth the cost for anyone who wants to use their smartphone or PDA for typing more than a few words.'], ['Once you get a keyboard for your pda / smart phone, you won't go back. This keyboard communicates via bluetooth and does a great job at turning your small device into a productive tool you won't want to be without. I use this keyboard with my Palm TX and it does a fabulous job during meetings - it's small (smaller than a notebook), VERY portable and reliable. the entire keyboard as well as my Palm PDA fits into the pant pocket of my cargo pants / shorts. You really can't get much more portable than that.To use you invoke a 3-button key combination to help it initiate contact with your device. Once connected, yo'll be off and running. My Palm TX will only stay on at 1-3 minute intervals so the only thing I don't like about this combination is that I have to keep hitting a key once in a while so my Palm doesn't shut off. This of course is a design flaw of the TX and not reflective of the keyboard.'], ['This keyboard fills my left pocket and my 'Ultra mobile PC phone' fills my right pocket.  This keyboard allows me to type at normal speed on a device I can keep in my pocket, and I was astonished to see that it would have even worked for text messaging on my older phone, the Nokia N-Gage.  If you have any HTC phone or any phone that supports bluetooth or this keyboard, or even a PDA, I highly recommend this product, although it is costly.  Pair it with anything that can run TextMaker Office for WindowsMobile and you have a meeting powerhouse in your pocket that can tackle the best college note taking in a much more mobile manner than a laptop, since you don\'t need to take it out of a bag, plug it in, and otherwise waste time.

No problem working up a sweat on the treadmill, but I must stress that I've not put in a summer run. I also must say that I do not expect longevity from a non-sweatoroof product, and that the s11 headphones are designed with a sweatproof nano coating. HOWEVER, since you asked, they still sound and work excellent. They bounce around running, but it's not intolerable... Just not ideal.

I'm going to work out in them anyway and I'll report back when they fail.=============================================================I bought the jaybird bluebuds x for my girlfriend, and I've used them several times, so that is my comparison point.These headphones have a very utilitarian, price conscious design. They don't sound as awesome as the $180 bluebuds, and they aren't as sleek as them (bluebuds are just a cord with tiny ear pieces). BUT, they are very easy to control, very light, and sound very good. I'm not taking away anything by saying they don't sound as good as the bluebuds... The bluebuds sound as good as Bose or klipsch wired models of similar cost (even MKBHD says they are amazing). The Motorola buds really sound great. I'd choose them based on sound over any of the cheaper wired sets I have (skull candy, JVC, etc.)The ear pieces, at first, I was worried about them. They didn't look like they would be very secure, but I was wrong. You can easily work out with them and they will stay in. And they swivel a bit at the ear pieces, so every time you move, you don't hear a bunch of thumping like many in-ear wired sets.And taking them out to hear the world around you is nice, because of the magnets. No flopping around.The built-in equalizer settings are nice, the controls are easy, and they stay around your neck when laying on your back.So you sacrifice some portability over the bluebuds, but you get a great ease of use, very good sound, and less than half the price.And truthfully, while they aren't super stylish...

Recently, the route I took has a lot of interference from the near by power lines and tower.  Music from LG glitches so much that I can't enjoy my music anymore.  I also have a Plantronics BackBeat Go 2.  This one is a little bit better, but my music still glitches and break up at the area with the most interference.  My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S4 Active and it's stored in my bike jersey back pocket, which is less than two feet from the headset.Before I try this unit, I went and try a LG HBS-750 (one user review said it has less interference).  HBS-750 was worst.  It started to break up even before I enter the interference area.I finally give this one a try.  Wow, I don't know what kind of power they use, I had three rides so far and I haven't experience one single glitch yet.  No music break up, no phone call conversation break up.  It's so nice to finally have some uninterrupted music.I problem I had was that once time, I receive a phone call and the party on the other side couldn't hear me.  I don't know if it's the other party or the headset.  The party calls me back and this time, when I press the pickup button, the headset doesn't respond with button push.The sound is very awesome as well.  I say the bass is better that the HBS-730.  The magnet is stronger as well.  I like it when I tuck the unit behind my shirt and when I am not using the ear plug and let it dangles, it naturally falls down and attached itself back to the magnet of the unit ... through my shirt.  This keep the earplug from swinging back and forth when I am not using it.  I don't know if this is by design or just accident.  Either way, it's cool.'], ['SPOILER ALERT: this is a stupidly long review. I like to provide as much detail as possible when I write a review, because that&#8217;s the sort of thing I look for in other reviews. Buying things from online retailers is great and all, but it prevents us from getting any hands-on information until we&#8217;ve already shelled out our money. Detailed reviews are the best way to combat disappointment and buyers&#8217; remorse. So either get some popcorn and/or a coffee, or skip to the end, or skip this review entirely &#61514;  Seriously though, it&#8217;s a long review. Prepare yourself.This headset is about as close to ideal as I'm probably ever going to get, at least until headsets are implanted subdermally behind the ear, or when music and communications are beamed directly into the brain or something. It has great sound, features, fit, and looks. There are a few downsides which I'll get out of the way first, and then I can get back to gushing about this thing. First, I feel that the earbud cords are maybe .5 to .75 inches too short. I wear this mainly when I&#8217;m at work, underneath the collar of my polo shirt. The cords therefor have to dip down under the edge of the collar, and then make the trip back up to my ears. It's fine if I'm looking straight ahead, but if I turn my head too much it will tug on the 'outside' ear (if I look left, it tugs on my right ear and vice versa). I've gotten around this somewhat by removing the little silicone o-rings that are intended to manage the earbud cords. It releases a little more cord length so the tugging is less noticeable, but it is still there. The cords are a bit short for my taste even when wearing a t-shirt, but aren&#8217;t too bad. The next downside is that the headset does not support connection to two devices at once. I get that this &#8220;one device at a time&#8221; thing improves the handoff between music and calls, since this is easier when both services are provided by one phone/device, but I still wish I could listen to my personal phone's music collection while being able to take calls from my work phone. Other headsets like the Sony MW600 handle this with ease. I should clarify that the Buds can be PAIRED with multiple devices, but can only be connected to one device at a time. Currently, I&#8217;ve got them paired with my Android tablet and phone, my iPod, and my work iPhone. I can switch from one to another by manually disconnecting from one and connecting to another (via each device&#8217;s settings), so I don&#8217;t have to go through the pairing process every time I want to switch &#8211; pairing the Buds is not difficult at all, but that would get annoying real quick.Now that I've got that out of the way, I can talk about the stuff I like about the Buds, which is pretty much everything. First off, let me assure you that this headset DOES support Apt-X Bluetooth connections where available. Apt-X is a Bluetooth audio codec that is designed to provide sound quality equal to a wired headset. Other Bluetooth audio connections have to compress the audio, making it sound somewhat muddled and, well, bad. This happens regardless of the quality of your source audio file. Apt-X support is most commonly available in recent Samsung (including the Galaxy S3, S4, and S5) and HTC phones (including the One and M8), but there are others out there as well. If you&#8217;re interested, there is a ridiculously complete .xlsx spreadsheet available from jessebandersen dot com, but a simple Google search will also yield results. I found Jesse&#8217;s page by searching for &#8220;aptx enabled devices&#8221; &#8211; it was the first result in the list. Sadly Apt-X is not supported by Apple yet, and knowing them they'll come out with some proprietary alternative to it that only works with their own headsets (they bought Beats by Dre in the last week or so, so get ready). I almost passed on the Buds because Apt-X isn't listed anywhere in the specs or reviews that I saw here on Amazon. I had to go to Motorola's site and look up the user manual to find it. I was originally going to go with the LG Tone headset line (which also supports Apt-X), but didn't like the &#34;flat loop&#34; design that most of them have &#8211; it looks like a great fit&#8230; for a robot. In my opinion the Buds are designed for a better fit on an actual human: the front of the control stalks bend gently down, following the curve of the neck/shoulders/collarbones. The majority of the headset (including the very small weight of the battery pack) rests on the base of your neck, and the control stalks rest comfortably near the collarbones. The LG Tone can't do both at the same time since it is formed in a flat circle: the stalks aren&#8217;t angled relative to the neck band, and they carry all the weight of the battery so they&#8217;ll fall to your collarbones while the center section will be halfway up the back of your neck (the newer ones are curved like the Buds, but are $70 more expensive). I&#8217;m wearing the Buds headset right now, and can hardly feel it &#8211; a great improvement over traditional &#8220;earhugger&#8221; Bluetooth headsets. While I&#8217;m talking about fit, I should probably mention that I wear a 17.5&#8221; collar, and can&#8217;t stand having things touching my neck or throat. The Buds fit quite comfortably, and provide just the slightest reassuring touch on the front sides of my neck. They widest gap between the left and right control stalks measures just a hair under 5 inches.The Buds have a tidy control arrangement and are easy to navigate. Play/pause/answer/end/track-skip commands (as well as EQ settings and voice dial activation) are handled by a rocker switch on the left, and volume adjustments are handled by a rocker switch on the right. The microphone is underneath the rocker switch on the left, and the power switch is underneath the body (center section) of the headset, next to the charging port. Play/pause/answer/end is done by a single press of the forward half of the left rocker switch, which has a little bit of texture to it for identification/grip purposes. You can activate voice dialing (like Siri or Samsung&#8217;s S-Voice or Google voice search) by long-pressing this same button while no music is playing. Track-skip forward is done by a single press of the back half of the same switch, and track-skip back is done by a double press. I kind of wish skip forward/back were handled by separate buttons, but it&#8217;s easy enough to get used to. One thing to note about the mic being on the same stalk as the answer/end button: if you have to feel around for the end call button, the person on the other end is going to hear ALL OF IT since the microphone is right beneath it. Lots of loud rustling noises. Oops. Not enough for me to list as a full-on downside, but still... kind of annoying. They could have placed the mic on the right, which come to think of it is a whole lot less &#8220;busy&#8221; since it mostly only has volume control functions. Volume down is achieved by pressing the forward half of the right rocker switch, and volume up by pressing the back half. You can mute an active phonecall by pressing both portions of the volume rocker, and reject an incoming call by long-pressing either one of the volume buttons. EQ modes can be changed by a long-press of the &#8220;Play/Pause&#8221; switch on the left. There are 3 EQ modes, but there is no indication of which one you are in, or documentation of what the effects are supposed to be. There is a voice notification of &#8220;EQ mode changed!&#8221; but that&#8217;s it. You&#8217;re on your own to figure out exactly what that means. My best guess is that the modes are flat, treble boost, and bass boost. As a general &#8220;audiophile&#8221; rule, flat EQ response is best since it doesn&#8217;t meddle with the sound balance and you hear it as the artist intended. I can barely tell which EQ mode is bass boost, but can&#8217;t tell the difference between the other two. And if I can&#8217;t tell the difference, then I guess it doesn&#8217;t really matter. I&#8217;d recommend switching modes while listening to your general type of music, getting to an EQ setting you like, and then never changing it again. As is obvious from the pictures and literature, the earbuds are held magnetically to the ends of the control stalks when not in use. The magnets are pretty strong, and the earbuds have yet to bounce themselves loose. In fact, they are so strong that if I remove an earbud from my ear but don&#8217;t attach it to the end of the stalk, I&#8217;ll eventually find that it has connected itself at some point as I&#8217;ve been moving around. Needless to say, don&#8217;t get any of these parts too close to any of your credit cards.As far as sound quality goes, I&#8217;m really impressed. The earbuds are said to have &#8220;Premium HD speakers&#8221;, and whatever that truly means, they sound great and the Apt-X support really helps them shine. I should point out that the Buds will still sound great with non-Apt-X devices like Apple gadgets, and will certainly sound as good as all other Bluetooth headsets that don&#8217;t support it. As long as the earbuds are seated properly (which is critical with any in-ear earbuds) bass response is nice and solid, and everything just sort of sparkles. Not saying that &#8220;sparkle&#8221; is added in any way, but if the music has fine detail in it then you&#8217;ll hear a lot more of it. Speaking of having the earbuds seated properly, the documentation talks a bit about about &#8220;micro-adjustability&#8221;, and what this translates into is that the stem of each earbud can pivot a certain amount around a central axis in a sort of narrow cone shape, so the angle of the stem relative to the earbud&#8217;s body can change a bit to fit different peoples&#8217; ear structures. The earbuds seem to stay fairly well seated unless I get really sweaty. Speaking of sweat, I will also note that the Buds are not labelled as &#8220;sweat proof&#8221;, which does make me worry a little bit. I sweat easily, and do a lot of biking and walking, and my work is somewhat physical too. Hopefully this does not become an issue. There is a little rubber plug you have to partially remove to access the charging port, so make sure you place it back securely before getting sweaty. Anyways, back to audio quality: One important thing to note, which is true of all high quality sound delivery devices, is that the final output depends highly on good source material. You should know by now that low quality sources like 128Kbps .mp3 files or even some tracks on Pandora and other streaming services aren&#8217;t the best, and with these you will hear every little bit of their badness. Other headsets may mask this but they&#8217;re also masking the fine detail of better quality files, so in a way it&#8217;s actually a good thing. Call quality on both ends of the line is really good as well, and I&#8217;ve never had anyone ask &#8220;Are you using Bluetooth?&#8221; which I usually get when I use other headsets. In fact, I had one person stop me in mid-conversation and ask &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say you were going to put on your bluetooth headset?&#8221;, and almost didn&#8217;t believe me when I said I already had. One last thing about audio quality &#8211; if you listen to music via any app with preamp gain, you may want to be reduce that gain level to zero. I use PowerAmp on my Galaxy S4 and was dismayed at first to hear a ton of distortion, especially in the low end. I almost returned the headset because I could not get rid of it. I eventually found that the preamp gain (on PowerAmp&#8217;s EQ settings page) was set to about 75% of its capacity, and turning it down eliminated the distortion completely. You can get rid of the distortion at 25%, but why risk it? I keep it at zero now just to be sure. Doing so also reduced the overall volume, but since these things get plenty loud on their own, I don&#8217;t mind at all.Usually I hate the looks of most Bluetooth headsets: the obnoxious blinking blue lights and the giant blobs of techno-crud clamped to peoples&#8217; ears make them look like extras from bad 80&#8217;s sci-fi movies. I have to say that the Motorola Buds practically disappear, especially while wearing them under the collar of a polo shirt. They do have an indicator light, but it is nestled in between the power switch and charging port, so it&#8217;s not visible at all while they&#8217;re being worn. I have to say, at first I wasn&#8217;t too pleased with the fact that even the black headset has white bits on it (the undersides of the flat cords, the silicone ear pieces, and the forward/inside halves of the earbud shells). I have changed my mind and have very much come to enjoy the subtle high-contrast design. It looks nice and modern without looking like it&#8217;s trying too hard. As I said, it practically disappears under a polo collar &#8211; all you can see is the white silicone ear pieces and a touch of the white from the cord. When you&#8217;ve got an earbud inserted, the white flash from the undersides of the cords help make it a little more obvious to others that you&#8217;re either listening to music or talking on the phone. I say &#8220;a little&#8221; because people still give me weird looks when they walk into a room while I&#8217;m in mid conversation. I have to make the universal &#8220;I&#8217;m not a lunatic, I&#8217;m just on the phone&#8221; gesture to most folks, but the observant ones can figure it out for themselves more easily. I see these now come in blue, which makes me even more sad that they don&#8217;t come in red. You see, I have a sickness. A sickness which has yet to be defined (or even acknowledged) by Science, in which I have an overwhelming love (some, like my wife, would say &#8220;unhealthy obsession&#8221;) for black things with red trim, or red things with black trim, or&#8230;  well, you get the idea. If these came in red, I&#8217;d sell 4 of my 5 pints of blood (or at least my black/white Buds) to get a set. Maybe one day.Those are the main points I wanted to talk about. There are a few more things that don&#8217;t really fit in the review elsewhere, so I&#8217;ll stick them here. The specs say that the wireless range is up to 150 feet, but that is with a &#8220;Class 1 Bluetooth device&#8221;, which your phone probably isn&#8217;t. Realistic use is still around 30 to 40 feet, with minor barriers like walls and doors. I don&#8217;t even know where to find a true Class 1 Bluetooth device, so get that 150ft range spec out of your head. Battery life seems to be pretty good, and although I try to charge the headset every night, I&#8217;ve gone as far as 2 full workdays of mixed usage without running out of battery. They&#8217;re rated at &#8220;up to 12 hours&#8221; of playback, but it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess as to what that actually means. I talked about the silicone earpieces earlier, but forgot to mention that they come in 3 sizes &#8211; small, medium, and large. The Buds come with the small ones installed already, but I found that the mediums were best for me. The earpieces on most of my other earbuds (both wired and wireless) are 99% interchangeable, but these are slightly different. The posts on the ear stems are a slightly smaller diameter than standard, so earpieces from other sets are a bit loose. Swapping other earpieces to the Buds would result in more sound leakage and result in poorer sound quality and bass response, and also put you at a much higher risk of having one of the earpieces coming off the stem and sticking in your ear. Trust me, you don&#8217;t want that. Stick to the 3 sizes provided and find the one that best suits you. Use the biggest size you can stand, because a good seal is critical for good sound quality. Another thing I mentioned briefly was the Buds&#8217; voice notifications. The Buds have a set of pre-programmed voice notifications built in that you&#8217;ll hear as you turn the headset on and off, or change EQ settings, and maybe a few other commands. When you power it up, the headset plays a short musical tune and then a chipper female voice says &#8220;Welcome to the Motorola Buds!&#8221; When you connect to a phone or mp3 player, the same voice says &#8220;Device 1 connected!&#8221; The voice isn&#8217;t too bad, but it took me a while to get used to. When you receive a phone call, it will play another tune at you instead of mirroring your phone&#8217;s ringtone. I think it&#8217;s a riff on the first few notes of &#8220;Ride of the Valkyries&#8221; but I could be wrong. The Buds also play a soft &#8220;bloop&#8221; noise every time you play or pause or adjust the volume. Other than these &#8220;bloop&#8221; noises, there is really no indication of whether or not the unit is even powered up. I mention this because if the headset loses connection it will automatically power down after 5 minutes to save battery. If you pick the headset up after a while and don&#8217;t know what power state it&#8217;s in, hit a volume button and listen for the bloop. The headset has yet to drop Bluetooth connection on its own, which is a first for all the headsets I&#8217;ve owned and is kind of impressive. The very last thing I wanted to talk about (yeah, I made a list) is that there are very thin rubber strips that run up the undersides of each control stalk, which I think serve the purpose of covering the track the wires run through. A small section of one of these strips popped up after about a week and would not seat itself back down. I eventually decided that they are probably held in place by some sort of adhesive, since I could not get it to &#8220;pop back in&#8221;, so I placed the tiniest dab of Krazy Glue in there, wiped off the excess, and held it in place until it dried. This was about a month ago, and it has not popped back up yet.So that&#8217;s absolutely every observation about the Motorola Buds that I&#8217;ve made since I got them. If you&#8217;ve read through all that, I salute you. I probably owe you 20 minutes of your life back. Sorry about that. Now on to the summary, which I promised at the start:For the tl;dr crowd, I wholly approve of this headset. It&#8217;s the headset I&#8217;ve been waiting quite some time for, and it&#8217;s finally here. Features, fit, sound, and looks are all pretty much perfect, and it&#8217;s hard to come up with a list of serious disadvantages. As I write this, it&#8217;s available here for $58, which is quite a steal. The nearest competitor is the LG HBS-800, which normally goes for $130. Check these out &#8211; I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll be disappointed.'], ['An excellent device works great and fits well in your ear .... truly useful while driving and when you have your phone in your pocket.

Compared to the Sidekick II and many other T-Mobile phones, the A630 has the best signal-keeping capability, but T-Mobile just sucks big time, unless you live right next to one of their sporadic cell towers.  Worse, their GPRS (data) network is slow and congested.  While surfing the web on the A630 is really cool when the network is accessible, for most part of the day the network is slow and often inaccessible.

For $20/month all you can eat data, this is a screaming deal.  I don\'t find the web surfing that useful (speed is about like a 28kbps dial-up connection) but for email it is superior to the Blackberry 957 I used a number of years ago.  The interface for the phone and for email and the address book is great.  Far better than any Nokia phone I have ever used.  The intellisync software allows me to create use a separate address book in Outlook that I can then sync with the SKII with a one button push.  Very simple and means you can have an abreviated address book if you are concerned about having this infor resident on TMO/Danger\'s servers.  I agree with another reviewier that it would be better that this info is NOT resident, but if that\'s a concern, limit what you leave on the server.Drawbacks are no bluetooth, no resident memory for email, pictures etc, no removable memory stick and no easy way to create and use your own ringtones.Great things, great keyboard (nicer/bigger than Crackberry), intuitive interface/software screen size/clarity.

They are rendered well enough such that you can move the material manually.  This varies - as long as they have a filename that ends in .vcf and a mime type of text/x-vcard or text/directory, and otherwise are formatted correctly, they will get taken. But, some applications, for example, evolution, that great Linux e-mail application, does not give something that was never a file a meaningless filename, so the sidekick will not file evolution\'s vcards (unless you export them to a file and resend them with the right mime type).Rather than picking the name of the vcard for import out of the vcard\'s formatting, the sidekick uses the filename. This might mean that it would be simply to pass garbage through the vcf interface, so be careful.You can get URLs in SMS messages and they show up as URLs, but you can\'t click on them. You can\'t click on URLs out of the AIM browser - you can copy the text and mail it to yourself, then click on the URLs out of the mail, where it pulls them out and makes them clickable at the end.The documentation says that the phone has a WAP browser. You might say, 'With a regular browser, why would I care about a WAP browser?' - The answer is bandwidth - you want to look up a phone number, WAP will be faster.  And there are some cool wap games. But the real answer, according to the T-Mobile Tech supervisor is that the WAP browser is vaporware - it does not work.  Maybe someday.  There are sites you can\'t browse without javascript that have working wap analogues (like microsoft\'s sms generation site).  So you can\'t browse them at all from the phone.That is about it.  Most of the rest is great. I moved my Nextel data over by exporting the data from the Nextel site, and, in openoffice, I rearranged the column names to match what would have been exported from Outlook Express, and then imported.  Oh, yes, I also built names with a formula. Saved it as a comma file, just like Outlook had, and, poof, in about a minute, a couple hundred phone numbers, addresses, and names migrated and merged and appeared on my phone.  I could have mailed vcfs for the 70-80 contacts that I was using, but that didn\'t work.I\'ve resisted all the games (I want MINESWEEPER - yes, I know it is lame).  I might have to drop $4 for solitare.I did drop $10 for the terminal program, and it has already become helpful - the terminal program is wonderful for something on such a tiny device. I can check out servers by connecting to them in raw mode, by port. I can ssh, securely, to my server. There are lots of disconnects, mostly related to when you stop typing to think for a couple of minutes, but a program available in Linux called 'screen' allows you to save programs running in the background and reconnect to them, see their output, get status, and all that stuff. I can even get on IRC using a character mode IRC client.Someone called me to fix something on a weekend - it was something I could have fixed in 5 minutes on a real terminal, it took eight on the tiny terminal. In many ways, emacs seems to work better than vi does in character mode, but they both work.One secret is that you can log in to your windows box using ssh in character mode using free products from cygwin or SFU (from Microsoft if you have pro). Command line only, sorry.To echo the comments about the AIM client, which is utterly reliable vs. the yahoo client, which drops and reconnects all the time, is probably worthwhile.The documentation suggests that you surf with graphics off for speed. But many buttons are graphical and, unlike every other character or graphics off browser that simply displays the alt text, or, if there is none, '[IMAGE]', the button completely goes away, which means that you can\'t access what the button points to. This essentially means that you have to leave graphics on to surf.Occasionally, web sites are mis-represented - on eBay, for example, there is an extra entry bubble generated between the search text bubble and the putton you push - if you enter text there (which seems the right place) searches don\'t work.Despite all these niggling problems, and t-mobile\'s hapless tech support, I am still giving this device five stars. The astounding thing about a poker playing dog is not that it wags its tail when it has a good hand, but that it can tell that it has a good hand at all.The difference between getting text directions and being able to pull up a map of the area you are in as you drive down the road is wonderful - and then javascript stops you from being able to pull up a turn by turn map as you need it.I did not expect to have something in my hand that would allow me to log in to my system using ssh, browse at all, much less pull up mapquest maps.'], ['I have used a lot of screen protectors for my iphone, and this one is the best.

This phone has been really great over the past 14+ months that I\'ve owned it (I have the blue version).  I\'ve not had ONE problem with it doing anything it shouldn\'t do (i.e. randomly powering off, antenna problems, etc).  I cannot say that for every cell phone I\'ve ever owned.  LG makes a great cell phone and within their different models, I think this one is the best I\'ve seen so far.  My brother has this exact model and loves it, too.The phone has a beautiful color screen, easy to navigate menus, a nice camera and video function, and OUTSTANDING battery life.  The only complaint I will echo is that it would be nice at times to have a speakerphone.  Other than that, this cell phone is the best I\'ve found - including several other LG models that friends and family own.'], ['I had it over 3 years and it was working great. Battery lasts very long. Phone is very durable and solid.'], ['Ok, so I used to have a Motorola T720 (one of the worst phones made), and a Motorola Timeport 8767 (One of the best phones ever made).  I needed a new phone and ventured into the local Verizon Wireless store.  I happen upon the LG VX7000 and think...this thing is huge!  I don\'t need a camera in my phone...but then I pick it up and play around with it.  It\'s pretty comfortable to hold.  The screen is nice, bright and clear.  I wind up purchasing one from VZW online and when the phone arrives, I put it to the test.This phone so far for me has been terrific! The phone itself is a tad larger than my last T720 but not by much...the main LCD is a nice bright TFT screen.  Included are some wallpapers, 3 'real' pics(A Sunset scene, an island scene, and a group of people scene), a Verizon Logo wallpaper and a few 'doodle type' cartoony pics.  You can change the settings for the display easily, as the UI for this LG is much better than my old Moto.  The front LCD is nice enough...you can also set a wallpaper here or use a pic taken from the camera to use as a picture ID when that person calls.Ringtones...kinda forgettable (I am beginning to think cell phone providers tell phone makers to make some pretty useless ringers so you download decent ones).  You can however, record your own which sound surprisingly good with the internal mic, as well as download them from Verizon\'s Get It Now Brew service.  You can also, use MP3\'s as ringtones through a little trick.  One think I like...this phone is loud!!  I can hear it ringing in a crowded shopping mall even.  The vibrate feature works well enough and can be activated quickly (though this requires you to flip open the phone).The camera is located where the 'hinge' of the flip would be and rotates so you can snap a pic of yourself without contorting your face and arms to face the lens.  You can also change some pic settings like black and white and sepia tones, etc.  The camera is quite decent for a VGA cell phone camera.  There is a flash though this is rather useless except for close up pics.  The camera also lets you take 15 sec video clips which you can save and email to your friends.  While I figured I\'d never use this feature, I have twice already.  The advantages of having the camera/video in something you always carry is quite nice...it\'s fine for candid moments and though your friends might know you have a camera phone, they won\'t probably guess you\'re video recording them. :DThe call quality is nice,loud, and clear...much better than my old cell phone. Battery life for me has been approx. 5 days with light usage and charges in a little over 2 hrs.  Mind you, the old 'blue versions' of this phone had a charging plug near the data port...the new 'black face' ones charge straight through the data port.The holster that came with mine (the black vx7000) was great...solid and not cheapy like some phones are.  Notice that the face of the phone flashes colored led\'s near the 'flash' when you receieve a call or are making one...some like it some don\'t.I like the phone and it\'s size is deceptive. Tonight I showed it to a friend and she said, 'that thing is huge!'..then we compared it to her Panasonic camera phone and she noticed...hers was bigger lol.  This is one of Verizon\'s best cell phones right now...highly recommended.'], ['Guys,I have used several of my friends bluetooth headsets (motorolas and jabras) and had decided I didn't want one.

It's quiet in the wind, it's battery lasts for days for me, it's easy to use, easy to pair and the sound quality is awesome!!  Nobody could ever tell I was using a headset.  It takes a bit to get used to the ear clip, but once you do there are no problems.  It may be a bit heavier and larger than some, but then those little tiny ones that look so chic also have TERRIBLE reviews and TERRIBLE performance!!

I left it in a drawer for a month, pulled it out and it was still ready to go!I use the device a couple of times a month on business, when driving, etc.  The windscreen is outstanding and cuts out noise even when driving with the window open.  some people complain about the ear piece.  It seems fine to me and you can adjust it easily, but keep in mind any headset is an annoyance when you first wear one.

Here are the reasons:- 7-8 Hours talk time- True 30 feet range- Wind filter for clear talking- Small and comfortable, doesn't intrude your ear- Crazy price, huge quality- Warranty and reliability of Logitech!I've used a Sony Ericsson and Jabra BT200 and I would say the Jabra is much better than Sony Ericsson, but the Logitech blows them both away.  It's faster to put on the Logitech and the range is much better.  The microphone is clear and crisp and the speaker volume is loud and sufficient.For me, I used a Jabra A210 bluetooth adapter for a Sprint Sanyo 8100 phone w/2.5mm headset jack.  It gave me BT on my phone so I could use this headset.  The auto-answer and hang up depends on your phone whether it would normally do so with a headset or not.

I was right this headset is very comfortable compared to another headset I just bought.  The ear speaker is loud even to the point that I don't have to have it on the highest setting.  The mic was the thing I was worried about though, so I called my friend's cell phone and talked to myself and I was pleasantly surprised with the sound volume and clarity.  Also I haven't had any complaints from other friends I've talked to with the headset.  It has been my experience that Logitech makes the best wireless devices for the buck and they didn't let me down with this one (second Logitech wireless devices in two month; I also bought their xbox controller which is definitely also worth the buy.)'], ['very cheap excellent value. the problem with most is their uselessness when confronted by windy conditions- this does a much better job than most. v simple instructinos, though it lacks the ability to switch easily between headset & phone & back.nevertheless at $35 or under, brilliant value.'], ['Because I spent a lot of time on the phone, I am very particular about BT headsets.  I have tried every brand of BT headset you can imagine, I mean EVERY brand.  I was so frustrated to a point I was ready to go back to wired headset until I ran into this little guy.  This is by far the best one, hands down.  My most miserable experence was with Jabra and Motorola.  I had a lot of connection and audio quality issues with those brands.BT headset designers seem to favor visual appeal rather than performance.  I don\'t understand by most headsets on the market are short and stubby, in which the microphone is right next to your ear instead of your month.  Having microphone that far away results in having to turn up the microphone sensitivity, which cause the headset to pick up everything including background noise.  Lack of an effective noise-filtering system such as the one in this Logitech headset, you end up with wind noise, car noise, AC noise, every kind of noise but your voice.  In additional, the close promixity between the speak and microphone creates a feedback loop for a nice serving of constant echoing.  I lost count of the occasions when my friends and coworkers on the other end of the phone tell me to 'get off your crappy Jabra BT headset' or 'take me off your Motorola BT headset'.  I am amazed that people on the other end can easily tell it\'s a Jabra BT headset because the horrid sound quality.Onto this gem, the sound quality is amazing, by far the best of the bunch.  The WindStop system really does work.  Together with the farther extending microphone, this unit produce the best sound both incoming and outgoing.  I know many users complaining about the fit, but it\'s really a fault of the user.  As one reviewer pointed out, there is a 'correct' way to wear this, and I think it provides an excellent fit and comfort.I can\'t speak for all, but I personally don\'t wear a BT headset as a fashion statement.  I use it as a mean for convenience and safety, so sound quality and fit are top factors for my consideration.  On that note, this is a clear winner.  I wish product managers and designers at Motorola and particularly Jabra take note of that.  Jabra (250 and 250v models) being the worst with it\'s behind the ear design and a heavy-trigger button is really a very lousy product in terms of usability and sound quality.  I am sure customers that raved about Jabra would rank this unit out of this world!'], ['We bought the Plantronics HL10 Handset Lifter to go with ourPlantronics CS-55 Dect 6.0 Digital Wireless Office Headsetand have been very pleased with both devices.

You can answer the phone or hang-up when the call is completed without ever touching the receiver.The lifter came with a plug in mini-microphone ring detector that attached to my base phone and it allowed the base station to notify me when the phone was ringing.

I was highly skeptical as I have been buying bluetooth headsets like crazy trying to find one that worked, and they're all pretty much junk. This thing worked all the way out to the sidewalk, and likely much further, but that's as far as I went. The quality on the other end is very clear. The manual is plain stupid, it looks like they were half way through putting it together when they released it, but on the Mac the manual was of course not needed, just plug it in and it worked without any of the driver install nonsense Windows requires. BTW, I am using it primarily with Skype.OK, I have to add something to this review. There's a fatal flaw in this device. A flaw that makes the device near worthless to me now. If the USB cable is unplugged, but the earpiece is left clipped into the holder/charger, the battery runs down within hours. Obviously a simple diode somewhere would have prevented this, but for me the device now is close to useless.Update: May 8th 2011.

I am having to constantly remove the battery to get the headset to work, and it's cutting me off in the middle of calls.

It is a dramatic improvement and I love it.The screen is now high res and looks incredibly clear, the Bluetooth works wonderfully with the wireless Jabra headset. When a call comes in simply hit answer on the phone and the call comes through the headset. I don't particularly like the comfort fit of the Jabra on my ear so I will probably be looking at other alternatives as well.The camera is now actually good enough to take snapshots you would keep. Almost as good as some of the low end digital cameras.  A few of the critical buttons are placed more intuitively.Initial setup went pretty smoothly, so far, it seamlessly upgraded my old Treo 600 software and imported all my contacts and calendar as well as almost all my applications.  The Sprint phone rep that activated my phone actually seemed to be quite knowledgable.The only real CON is that the Treo 650 Hotsync cable connector is big and clunky compared to 600. IMHO they made a backward step by replacing the sleek original Treo connector with the Tungsten design connector. It requires a separate power supply to charge.  I have been used to charging my Treo 600 through the single USB hotsync cable to my laptop.  This extra power connection is a messy annoyance.  The upside is that since the battery is removable I can have a spare charging elsewhere.Overall opinion is that I wouldn't even consider returning to or buying a Treo 600 now that the Treo 650 is available.'], ['I purchased this phone a few months ago and can truly say it is one of the best investments I have ever made!

The styling, design, and construction is just that good (I upgraded from a trusty and reliable, yet mediocre Nokia 3360 TDMA phone).There's been quite a debate about the construction of the V3 and the best explanation that I've heard is that the bottom backside (below the battery cover) and the lower front is plastic for the antenna.

This is great for single-point access for data and charging -- it's simple and should be a mobile phone standard!2- The Bluetooth connectivity. Coming from a wired hands-free setup, my Bluetooth headset (a Jabra BT250) is a godsend. I can leave the V3 charging in my home office and still be connected in the living room. (SIDE NOTE: stay away from from the D-Link Bluetooth USB adapter for PC connectivity and get the Belkin F8T001 adapter -- read my review on the D-Link for details)3- Quad band. Doubtful that I'll ever use this feature/benefit, but those two words will certainly impress all around you.4- The speakerphone. I've been a non-believer of mobile phone speakerphones, but I've got to admit, the V3's speaker phone is the bomb. It's loud and clear (but not loud enough for the car). My girlfriend tells me that I sound better w/ the V3 speakerphone than w/ my old Nokia 3360 and wired headset setup. When I don't have my Bluetooth headset, I'm spoiled w/ the speakerphone.5- The internal display. Going to the V3 from the Nokia 3360 is a leap of spacial proportions and after a couple of weeks, I have found myself to be spoiled w/ large internal display. And not only that, the V3 has an ATI IMAGEON graphics accelerator! All other phones (excluding PDA phones) pale in comparison in this regard.Mikey's no-likeys:1- No memory expansion. I don't see myself using up all 5MB of internal memory, but an SD/MMC card expansion slot would be nice. Maybe Motorola (or somebody else -- maybe myself) will come out w/ a mini-USB adapter for this purpose.2- Poorly written owner's manual. I have found that the owner's manual is more like a reference manual and sometimes leaves you figuring things out on your own. It does not explain how to use many common features that owners (especially ones new to Motorola phones) use. Instead, it lists all the features and expects you to put 1 and 1 together. It's like the &#34;C++ Reference&#34; vs &#34;Learn How to Program in C++ in 21 Days.&#34; Maybe Motorola's technical writers are just to technical?3- Drops and dings. Like any &#34;Ferrari,&#34; I'll probably go into a week-long mourning the first time I drop or ding the phone. I'm hoping there will be [good] cases available to protect my V3 while it juggles around w/ keys in my pocket. (SIDE NOTE: I have heard that Cingular / Lockline is not insuring this phone, but my Cingular sales guy was hesitant sell me the phone unless I bought the insurance)4- No EDGE. My girlfriend's $99 Motorola v551 has EDGE. Shame, shame, shame Motorola. Bad Motorola. Bad, bad, bad. Alas, it's akin to buying a $160k Ferrari 360 Modena and having a cheap $20 factory stereo system (or paying $90k for an Acura NSX and it's only 290hp).5- Internal display colors. I was all hyped up to hear about 260k colors, but Motorola's specs after some detective footwork is 65k colors, but up to 260k colors in MPEG-4 video playback. Very, very, sneaky and mis-leading indeed.Wishlist:1- I wished there was a PocketPC smart phone version of this phone. PocketPC + V3 form factor = perfection.Regarding multiple numbers for one name in the review below -- you can set the phonebook to display only primary numbers by:1- setting the primary number for all the names that have multiple numbers (you don't have to do this if a name only has one number);2- set the address book view to &#34;Primary Contacts&#34; in Phonebook Menu &#62;&#62;&#62; Phonebook Setup &#62;&#62;&#62; View;3- voila, only primary numbers are displayed.The way Motorola has implemented this is not very intuitive as Nokia's implementation (refer to my owner's manual dis-like above), but I have found Motorola's implementation to be a little more robust.UPDATE: It's been nearly three weeks since I've bought this phone and no buyer's remorse.'], ['I\'ve had this phone for a while now and here\'s what I think.The User Interface has had a bad rap from some people, and yes, it\'s not as intuitive as say, Nokia\'s interface, but it does have some pros.  You can customize every button, including all 4 arrows, and the left and right soft keys.  I have my left soft key programmed to go to 'Shortcuts' and I have every function I need right there.  And of course, after a while of use, you will get used to the interface.The volume of the phone is decent.  I have no problems hearing other people, and they have no problems hearing me.  Speakerphone works great too.  My boyfriend says that he no longers feels like he\'s talking to someone in a tunnel when I use speakerphone for our calls.  The only volume problem I can see is that at the highest volume (7), it is still slightly hard to hear your phone ring.  One other thing - this phone has way cool ringtones.The address book issue is this:  If you use your SIM card to store your addresses, then no, you will not be able to have multiple entries for one person.  But if you use your phone\'s memory to store your numbers, you can have many many numbers stored to each entry.  I have all of my numbers stored on my Powerbook\'s address book, so I\'m not too worried about having them on my SIM card.  And if you have a MAC, iSync works wonders with syncing numbers/calendars to the RAZR....now THAT\'S cool!The screen is very large and clear.  I have no problems seeing it in dark or even bright light.  I have had no problems with reception with Cingular so far.  In fact, I have a stronger signal in most places than my previous phone (Nokia 6230)Overall, I am very pleased with the design, functions, and asthetics of this phone.'], ['If you look carefully at these so called 'bad reviews' you will notice most of them either don\'t know how to use the phone OR may have been the 1-2 out of 1000 that received a faulty phone which happens from EVERY manufacturer, EVERY brand, EVERY type of phone.Now my wife & I have had ours for 12 days so far with no problems whatsoever, we ordered 2, I got the Black one she got the silver one. Got BOTH for FREE btw.Just a word about those of you like us that want a 'shared plan' from Cingular BUT Amazon does not offer those plans while you order, I ordered 1 phone with 1 cheapest single plan each, now when Amazon sends you the conformation that your order has been shipped you get your 'Cell phone Numbers' right then in the email.I simply called Cingular gave them the phone numbers of each phone told them the deal and had the service changed to a 'single 700 rollover mins shared plan' before we even got the phones in our hands, so there is no problems at all in that respect. Once we got the phones I called back to check and yes the person from Cingular had done everything as asked, I also checked from the phone itself as you can go to 'My Account' from the Main Menu page and phone goes online and checks everything about your account, how many minutes, the plan, when the next bill is due, etc etc, and sure enough everything was as it was supposed to be.As far as signal strength it is excellent in my area, I can go all through our house upstairs and downstairs and it stays between 4-5 bars, I don\'t recall seeing less than 3 bars all around town so far, the phone gets a great signal, and Cingular 'in my area' puts out a great signal.My wife just came back from a business trip, she was about 150 miles away 'With NO ROAMING charges' btw our last cell phone service 'Alltel' would have been roaming within 20 miles.Anyway when she got to the hotel she called we both had perfect signal strength, we both put phone in 'Speaker Phone' mode and she just laid the phone in closed position on the night stand while she unpacked her suitcases, I put mine on my night stand and we talked for about an hour with no problems at all, and it was a FREE call 'Mobile to Mobile'.We sent a couple text messages to each other that worked no problem.She used the phone as her Alarm clock the next morning which worked perfectly.Now as for what 1-2 reviewers have said about the battery life, most likely they have gotten one of those 1-2 out of 1000.I\'ve had phone 12 days have charged it 3 times and have never let it go to the point where is says it 'needs' charging, so average 4 days per charge and just like the manual states it appears as though battery life is getting a bit better after a few charges, So I\'m easily going to get 3-5 days per charge, and that\'s with a lot of fiddling around with it because it\'s new and 1-2 hours talk time.Some one mentioned they dropped the phone on its hinge and it broke. I have yet to drop the phone but it seems to be very well made to me, either way I would suggest getting a Krusell cover for it which I did but has not been delivered yet, and also insurance for $4.99 a month from Cingular which covers anything and everything for life of the phone, thus that problem is solved.Someone mentioned something about the 'address book being slow' not even sure what that means, I only have about 8 numbers in it so far but it comes up virtually instantly for me, maybe if you have 100++ numbers in it might take a couple seconds? dunno.As for searching through the phone book, they mentioned you have to make a new entry for each number for same person, NO you don\'t, you have the option to show numbers any way you wish, either by 'Name' or 'Speed dial #' or 'Voice name' or even by 'Email' and with or without a picture of the person.Someone said it took them 5-10 seconds to open address book and dial a number from it, well I just now did it in under 3-4 secs, not to mention if you have it set for 'Voice command' it takes 1 sec.Want it faster and easier if you have a lot of names/entries? then set it for 'list only' 'no picture' and by 'primary number only', simple. You can also separate numbers even further by putting in 'Categories' such as 'Business/Personal/General/VIPs'Bring up Category your number is in only that way even if you have 100s of Names & #s it thins them to category.When you have 'primary number only' listed all you need to do then to get all the other numbers & Email listing for that Name is to 'Highlight name and use left or right on the Navigation button to get all the other numbers' once again very simple and easy to use. I find the Phone book to be excellent & fast.1-2 have mentioned something about 'ear piece volume too low'  the ear piece volume is fine just make sure the 'volume' is turned up and it is just a good as any other cell phone I have ever used, make sure your ear is right at the 'top edge of the phone', too low and volume will sound low. Someone mentioned to take out the little blue cover, do NOT do that since it has nothing to do with ear piece volume, there are 4 speaker holes along the top edge of phone just make sure center of your ear is even with these holes and volume is just as loud as any phone you have used.Now myself I find the phone overall to be excellent, gets a great signal, has way more than enough features for me, works very well for its intended purpose 'PHONE' seems to be very well made, nice size, looks great, has a really nice screen with sharp image & colors.I have only ONE complaint so far......The screen which looks outstanding inside under any indoor lighting, especially if you are in the dark, well that same screen outdoors under 'sunlight' is virtually unreadable. So there you have my one gripe.I will come back and update this if anything changes, but as for right now and for FREE and can hardly see how you can go wrong with this phone.UPDATE: 4/08/08My wife and I still have both of these phones, neither of us have had even one single problem with them and its getting close to 3 years of everyday use (these are our only phones, we only have cell phone service no land line).The only slight problem we have had in over 2 1/2 years is when we finally had to change the battery we went with the cheap $5 battery that you can find several places and they were no where even close to as good as the original battery but that is not the fault of the phone.These phones have preformed flawlessly and we use the hell out of them.'], ['I bought this phone because it was a Editors choice in a leading computer magazine.  I would have preferred the Motorola V3 Razor but that is still far too expensive and I have found that this phone is basically the same as the Razor just not as thin or stylish.Plus points of this phone include:- A beautiful screen. It is large, bright, and has excellent resolution.- very good pictures from the camera.  I can't believe that it is just .3 megapixels... of course you won't be able to blow them up into posters or anything like that but for viewing on a computer or even the occasional 3x5 print the pictures are very good.- excellent sound quality from the speaker so your ringtones and the speakerphone sound great.- very nice construction with a easy to grip rubberized metal trim and back.- the button layout is very nice with a dedicated button for taking pictures and volume buttons on the side.  Also of note is that most of the buttons are user programable.- the phone also has voice dialing and picture caller id (although the pictures are very small and do not appear on the external display)- the bluetooth is very easy to set up and use- it is a true Quad band phone that can be used worldwide (although it has to be unlocked first).- excellent battery life.  I can't believe some of the reviews that say it needs to be charged every day... I find myself charging the phone after about 4-5 days with moderate use.  Of course I have the screen saver turned off and I make sure that the bluetooth is disabled when I am not using it so maybe that is why I have great stanby and talk times.  Also the place where I purchased my phone told me to charge it for 24 hours before the first use (to condition the Li battery) so maybe this has helped to increase the battery life.The Negative points about this phone include:- the blue external display looks cool but I think it would be more visible if it were typical backlit black on white LCD (like on the motorola v180)- the instruction manual (like most Motorola manuals) does not do a good job of explaining all the features so you will have to play with the phone a little bit to fully make use of all that this phone can do.- Even though the pictures from the camera are excellent, the video quality is not so good.  Of course this is a cell phone not a video camera so I guess it is about what you would expect.  Also there is no flash on the camera (unlike some other camera phones) so low light pictures are not that great.- there is no USB port on the phone so unless you want to buy a motorola cable, the only way to transfer pictures to your computer (and mp3's to your phone) is via bluetooth. (HINT: you can get a bluetooth adapter for less than $20 bucks so don't waste your money buying the motorola cable. Also with the bluetooth adapter you won't need any special software to transfer pictures or mp3... just use the software with the bluetooth adapter).- the connector for the charger has the typical motorola design so occasionally you have to jiggle it to get it to fit in just right but make sure that your PRESS the button on the connector before removing it or else you will damage the contacts... this may be why some users are having problems charging their phones- the phone only comes in blue so it does not look as cool as other motorola phones like the v180 or the razorAll in all this is the best phone that I have owned.  User's who complain about call drops and bad signals should be complaining about the carrier and not the phone.  Personally I have noticed that ever since the Cingular and AT&T; merger, signal quality and call quality have both declined.  A Cingular rep told me it is temporary until they are able to better integrate both networks... this makes sense because I have only had this problem since I switched my SIM card to the new Cingular SIM that makes use of both networks.'], ['I've had this phone for about four months now, and I haven't had a single technical problem with mine, even after a couple of typical drops on paved surfaces.  I do charge it every night; however, I've found that the Bluetooth radio makes a very significant difference in battery life, which may spur some of the complaints about the shorter battery life than the V400 (no BT capability on that one).  It is possible to turn off the BT radio if you don't need it for any accessories or connections.  My charge lasts for several days if I do this.  I really don't feel inconvenienced by charging daily and leaving BT on, though.In general, the phone has great screen quality (compared directly to my friends' V400s), great speakerphone and polyphonic ringtone capability, great sound quality at both ends, great voice dialing performance (very useful with headset), and I'm entirely satisfied with the camera, considering it IS a cellphone camera.I'll admit the interface was a bit cumbersome at first, but it's VERY customizable with changeable function keys, shortcuts, and menu orders.  I find mine very efficient since I've tweaked it to suit my tastes and usage.Additionally, contrary to some previous reviews, I have successfully transferred both information (phone book, etc.) and media (pictures, ringtones, etc.) to and from the phone with my Bluetooth adapter on my PC, without using Cingular's services.  I did have some trouble getting it to work initially, but I found that it was my firewall getting in the way (remember, Bluetooth IS a network connection).I suppose my one complaint is the conspicuous absence of games (only comes with a Bejeweled demo), but in the end it doesn't really bother me.  I could buy a game for $4 if I really wanted one.Overall, I find the phone very feature-rich and high quality, efficient to use once customized, and as rugged as the average cellphone.'], ['I owned one of these for about three months, then it started to fall apart.  It was $30 at Best Buy.  I haven't replaced it, as $30 is a *lot*.$10?  I'm buying two more.  I can be moving 20 mph on my bicycle, talking to someone, with no problems.  It has far better sound quality than my 'backup', which is a Jabra with no boom.  The ear volume is adjustable on my phone, and I'm wondering what phones other reviewers have that won't let them adjust the volume?'], ['Great sound, I use my phone for music at the gym so I am moving around and I have had no problems.

Isn't it great?! Of Course it is :)I'm glad that I've tried it, I was even thinking if it won't keep the power for 3 hours for talking I'll need to go in AT&T; store and by original one for $40, the old one that was going with one kept the power for one and a half years. Will see for how long this one will leave.'], ['Anywhere else this battery costs at minimum 4 times more. Even with the shipping it's a steal.

I would highly recommend this product.'], ['Product arrived on time. I charged the battery fully and it works as intended with no problems in my phone.'], ['Can't go wrong for under $25. I bought this when it was $40 and I've been very happy. I replaced my Jabra headset after I lost it. I think this is actually more comfortable. I've never had any of the issues described here. It's seems to be very clear and nobody on the other end has ever complained about not being able to understand me. Maybe I just talk louder than everyone else. :)'], ['Battery powered so no charging.

Howeva I am all about putting it in nice cases. This case hits a stars. Has a credit/ID slots and a money slot - Love that - so I don't have to carry a purse. Plus the strap is nice to have on wrist while on the phone (you know how crazy people are now a days running by snatching phones, extra secure). Best parts phone is secure in case holder when flip case over open. There is an appropriate hole in the back of case for the S-pen removal. Also the phone button closes versus most magnetic closure cases out here.Only con: No Speaker hole in front to close case while talking on phone.Howeva regardless -- highly recommend. Might get another in another color.'], ['This is the perfect case for my phone.

Had to send it back.'], ['Not pleased with the first cover she ordered for her Samsung Galaxy Note 2, my wife is loving this one by BoxWave.  She loves the compartments for her ID, credit card, and money.  The fit is good, no problems taking pictures or talking.  She likes the carrying strap as well, and the case's flexibility.'], ['This is a great case for the Note 2.  I had been undecided about whether to use a cover such as this or a belt holster as I've always used.  I wound up ordering both, this and a REIKO case.  They both work good separately, but not together.  If you try to use both, it is almost impossible to remove the Note 2 from the REIKO as it becomes stuck due to the tight fit.  I decided to use the BoxWave exclusively and have not been dissatisified with my decision.  I simply slide the Note 2 into my front pocket.  And no, the phone isn't too big for my pants pocket.The pros for this case is that it makes the Note 2 look stylish, and due to the rubbery feel, it makes the phone feel quite stable in my hand; however, the rubbery feel doesn't interfere with it going in and out of my pocket.  If I had to come up with a con for the BoxWave Tuxedo Suitup case, it would be that due to its glossiness, it shows fingerprints,  However, they wipe off easily.In summary, I would definitely order one of these cases again.'], ['I received this item in Dec. Been using it since then. Wanted to make sure I liked it and it did its job. It is light weight and does not add any bulk to the phone while protecting it. Well worth the money. I am thinking of ordering a few more of these in different colors. :-)'], ['My favorite TPU case. Offers enough protection and grip, can take off easily and slip it right back on. I can slip a couple of cards and bills between the phone and the case if need be.'], ['This case is a little thicker than my old TPU slim case but I expected that and really like the firmness of the material used.  No gaps or flimsy rubber on this.  This is my everyday case now.  Fit and finish as great and feels good in the hand.'], ['Fits well, offers decent protection and gives the phone good grip at a good price. I would order this case again.'], ['This thing is sweet. I have to say that so far this is the best case that I have tried out from Box Wave. It slipped on very snug and was even harder to get off. Although it is not impossible to get off it is difficult which is a good thing in my book. This case is very comfortable in the hand and just feels right. All controls were easily accessed and everything on my Galaxy Note 2 worked fine with the case on it. The only thing I didn\'t like was that this does not come with a holster. I like to use holsters and carry my phone on my belt. Well I did manage to find a holster from one of my earlier purchases for my phone and it fit the Box Wave like a glove. It was from one of those 2 piece rubber and hard plastic cases that Amazon sells for about $7.00. I can\'t remember the name but as soon as I do I will update this review so you can order this case and holster combo just for the holster. I have had the chance to locate the name of the case and holster and it is from 'Rhino' brand. The ones I have were 'Black Rhino'. I hated the cases but the holster is a perfect fit for this Box Wave case.'], ['Bought to replace another that I bought for my wife a year ago and it is great. Not heavy, stand work the way it should and it fits like a glove. Gives grate stability to the slippery side of the phone and allows for one handed function.'], ['I have bought many cases for many different cellphones and this is the first case that compelled me to write a review.  This is by far, THE best case I have ever had.  It fits so perfectly, yo'd think that it was meant to be a second skin for the phone.  and the fact that it doesn't add a lot of bulk, but feels like it will protect very well makes it that much better.  This case is worth more than double or triple the price.  I wish they made this exact case for every phone.  It would be my go-to case.  Please make one for the HTC ONE!'], ['First, I\'m a huge fan of TPU cases; and hate silicone ones.  There\'s a huge difference, in case you, the reader, doesn\'t know.  TPU is better... LIGHT YEARS better!But there are a lot of not-so-good TPU cases out there; and not because there\'s anything wrong with the TPU. Rather, it\'s because they\'re cheaply made, or not cut precisely accurately... that sort of thing.This particular case is the very epitome of precision cut.  It\'s perfect.  Every hole is centered on whatever it reveals beneath... the camera lens, the flash, the speaker, the mic holes, the earphone jack, and, of course, the stylus.  Note that there\'s no holes for the power button or volume rocker......and that, TRUST ME, is the way it SHOULD be!  So many of these TPU cases make cutouts for the power button and volume rockers, and that\'s a huge mistake.  If you\'ve ever cleaned an old-style computer mouse -- you know, the ones with the hard rubber ball partially hanging down out of the centerhold on the bottom -- if you\'ve ever open one of those up and cleaned one, then you\'ve seen the dark kinda\' fuzzy weird stuff that you must scratch off all the rollers and whatnot.  That stuff is body oil, mixed with skin cells, mixed with dust and hair, mixed with lint from the mouse pad, mixed with godknows what else.  It gets into and under and around virtually anything which humans touch......including down inside and around the hardware buttons on a smartphone!  And when that stuff gets in there, buttons stick, and phones either won\'t turn on or off, or can\'t have their screens awakened properly... or, one of the common ones which people often don\'t realize is caused by a sticking power button:  boot loops!Having a TPU cover which covers the power button and volume rocker helps eliminate that problem.  Of course, there\'s still the electromechanical HOME key that\'s uncovered; and if you look on YouTube you can find examples of phones which their owners mistakenly believe are broken, because their HOME keys cause weird behavior; but, in fact, all that\'s wrong is that over time the HOME key has gotten all gunked-up with the aforementioned body oil, mixed with dust and hair, mixed with... well... you get the picture.There\'s not a lot we can do about the HOME key problem (if it\'s a hardware electromechanical one, as opposed to a simple capacitive on on the glass), but we sure can keep the crap out of our power buttons and volume rockers with TPU cases that cover them......and this one does... and magnificently.  It even has nicely-molded buttons (as opposed to cheap TPU cases which just have a sort of bulge with a little bit of texture added to it.  This case is simply molded beautifully!This case is special for another reason, too, which many people, I\'ll bet, don\'t know about, and that\'s precisely how its sides wrap up and onto the front face of the phone: the bezel around the glass screen.  It\'s really nice, and very different from how other TPU cases do it.Remember that the Note II is kinda\' unique in that the very, very edges of its glass screen  aren\'t like almost any other phone.  Most phones have a perfectly flat piece of glass as their screens; and then there\'s the metal bezel of the case which almost comes into contact with the glass\'s edge all-\'round; and the top of the bezel is ever-so-slightly elevated above the flat plane of the glass screen, so that if you place the phone on its glass screen on a table, the glass, itself, it not actually touching the table because that bezel edge is holding it a millimeter or so up off the table\'s surface.Well, the Note II\'s glass is actually higher up (when it\'s lying on its back) than the bezel edge of the case; and, in fact, the very, very edge of the Note II\'s glass seesm to roll over and down toward the case\'s bezel. As such, if you lay the Note II on its face (on its glass, it\'s the glass that actually touches the table.  This makes for a bit of nightmarishness with regard to screen protectors; and one maker of them (REALOOK) manufactures two dry-apply versions for the Note II: one that sits on just the flat part of the Note II\'s screen, and so leaves a wider-than-normal amount of uncovered glass between the edge of the screen protector and the actual glass edge; and then they make another (the REALOOK '3D' screen protector for the Note II) that\'s molded to actually wrap over the rounded edge of the Note II\'s glass, and 'hang' down over it, so to speak, to make the protector\'s edge come closer to the case\'s bezel, and causing it to COMPLETELY cover the glass and its rounded edge.With most TPU cases, the TPU sides wrap up and over onto the face of the glass; and with totally flat screen protectors which leave a half millimeter or so between the screen protector edge and the bezel, that\'s fine.  The TPU case actually ends-up covering that edge and make it look like the screen protector is covering the entire glass.  But with the  REALOOK '3D' style screen protector that wraps over the edge, that other kind -- the most common kind -- of TPU case can cause the edges and corners of the 3D screen protector to curl or pull up.This BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp case is magnificently shaped so that its edge around the glass protrudes up higher than the plane of the glass, so that if the phone is laid on its face (on its glass sreen), the glass doesn\'t touch because it\'s being held a millimeter or so up off the table or desk.  But it gets better:  That edge 'respects' the rounded edge of the Note II\'s glass, and doesn\'t try to wrap up over onto and cover it.  Therefore, the REALOOK 3D screen protector\'s edges and corners remain intact and look beautiful.This is a very special TPU case... different from most others... and the only kind you can have, actually, if you use either a wet- or dry-apply screen protector whose edges go either all the way to, or over the edge of, the Note II\'s glass.Seriously, this thing is PRECISION... someone REALLY took a moment to figure out how best to cover the unusual Note II... and got it PERFECT!The only thing I wish it had was a matte finish back so that it wouldn\'t show such fingerprints.  The TPU cases out there that are called 's-style' or 's-series' TPU cases have matte finish on one side of the 's' shape on the case\'s back, and a shiny finish (like this case has everywhere) on the other side of the 's' shape on the case\'s back.  The entire back of this BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp should be the kind of matte finish that\'s on those 's' cases, in my opinion; or there should at least be an option to get it either way.Sadly, those 's' series or style cases are of the type whose side wrap all the way up and over onto and touching the glass, and on the Note II, that doesn\'t work well with most screen protectors. Plus, many of those 's' style or series cases have uncovered power and volume rocker buttons. Most of them also leave too much phone uncovered around the camera and flash... none of which are problems with this BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp; and so for me, at least, it\'s worth it to just endure its shiny, fingerprint-showing surface.Great case!  Best-of-breed, at least among cases that don\'t cause the edges and corners of screen protectors to curl-up and pull-up.  If one is not using a '3D' type of screen protector from REALOOK, though; if one is using REALOOK\'s other screen protector that attaches to just the flat part of the Note II\'s screen, then any of the other TPU cases for the Note II would be fine (as long as they cover the power and volume rocker buttons); but the thing is that few of them are made as nicely as this one. Seriously, this one is made very, very well... very precise. I just love it!Gregg L.

This doesn't have cutouts for the buttons, instead it has well-designed buttons of its own molded into the case that push on the phone's buttons.  I like this because the buttons work just as well but they are protected at the same time from crud/damage.  Cutouts for the ports/mics/camera/stylus are placed perfectly and sized appropriately.

When I put the phone in the case, it came out almost immediately. Solution: take the back cover off the phone then put it in the case. It holds it much more securely and now I don't have to worry about it. The case itself seems well made and thicker than I had hoped, but hopefully that will protect the phone well. The one thing I am worried about is how thin the plastic is that holds the phone in the case. I'll give an update if it breaks or chips like many other reviewers, but until then, great case.'], ['Given that this is half the price of Twelve South's bookbook case for iPhone 5, I expected to get a cheap imitation here.I think it's fair to say this IS a Twelve South imitation, but it's a close copy of their iPhone 4/4S bookbook style of case, not their iPhone 5 bookbook case. (The new Twelve South iPhone 5 bookbook case has a clip to secure the iPhone 5, rather than sliding the phone into the leather holster and securing with the tab at the top.) Personally, I loved the Twelve-South's bookbook case for iPhone 4/4S, but didn't like the new Twelve-South bookbook case for iPhone 5 and I returned mine - it looked cheaply made, it was an extremely tight, awkward fit getting the phone into the clip and the case had large remnants of glue coming out of the over-sized piece of plastic they decided to stick in the (rather enormous) hole they cut for the camera.  This product is better quality than the Twelve South product.  It certainly looks and feels like real leather, although I suspect it may not be (based on its smell).  If it turns out to be imitation leather, that would just be a bonus for me, because I'm mostly vegetarian anyway :-)  If this were the same price as the Twelve South bookbook case for iPhone 5, I would still prefer this BoxWave case.'], ['This is a great case for the Samsung Galaxy S3 and BoxWave does a great job in making a quality classy durable product.

Many people often mistake it for a journal, calendar, bible, etc.  I also like that it protects my screen in the closed position.  A great product.'], ['Want to basically eliminate your issues with holding this device in a secure way while maintaining the total coolness of it?This may be just what you were looking for. Seems to be actual leather unlike many similar cases that claim to be leather and are actually plastic. So if you wear skinny jeans and tend to keep the phone shoved in a pocket, this is not for you. But if you carry it elsewhere and are not concerned with combining your phone with some essential bits of your wallet, this is really really nice. If you tend to travel in a car and wind up carrying both the phone and your wallet into places to eat. This allows you to get three basic things out of the wallet and eliminate the need to carry two into the restaurant.It makes holding onto the phone less complicated by a factor of a googol. Particularly in landscape.The material (seems to be leather) is impregnated with a serious amount of oil so when you close the lid, it leaves a mark on the face of the phone. The simple solution to this is to get a paper index card, fold it at the red line on the top and shove the little folded bit in to the slot behind the cards. Not only do you then have the &#34;old way&#34; to fall back on if you need to actually write anything down )or have someone write something down for you(, but you add a perfect layer of weightless scratch proof protection to your ever so fragile Nexus 4 screen.For less than what you might pay for the 'official' bumper....no brainer.'], ['This case is great quality and nice Grey color. I have only had it one day so no long term review yet.'], ['I\'ve previously owned a multitude of headsets, but let me tell you I was missing out until I bought a Jabra.I always thought the 'in the ear' bud and bulky-looking design would be uncomfortable, but it was not.  Frankly it is the the most comfortable headset I have ever worn, and I\'ve worn dozens.  I truly forget it is on my head.As for sound quality, everything I hear is clear, with ample volume available.  People I speak to report equally clear sound without much, if any background noise.Battery life is great and range is sufficient for me to put my smartphone on the cradle and walk around the house or the office without any signal loss or crackling.Something else I liked was the belt clip.  So many headsets overlook the fact that you have nowhere to put your earpiece when you\'re not using it.  The belt clip is small, just big enough to actually hold the headset, and tucks in right behind the clip for my phone.If you\'re not a clip-loving person, the whole headset has an almost flat profile so it fits nicely in a pocket.  Other headsets, especially those with flip-out mics feel awfully bulbous in a pocket.One last little 'Gee Whiz' feature- the vibro-alert.  Since I want my phone on the charge/sync cradle whenever possible, this feature really excites me.  Instead of being required to actually wear the headset at all times to avoid missing a call when the phone is in the other room, this headset has a vibrate feature to notify me of an incoming call.  I call this a 'gee whiz' feature because I never knew I needed it until I had it!In summary, there are an awful lot of headsets out there.  All of the designs and features can be confusing, but you can rest assured knowing that this headset has everything you need (and some things you may not!) and does so at a very reasonable price.'], ['After trying the Motorola HS 810 which would feel like it was always falling off or falling off, I tried several Bluetooth headsets at the Sprint and Cingular stores. Other than the Jabra, they were all the same, they had a loop that you hook onto your ear, so they did not fit.This is the only one headset that would properly wrap around my ear and because the ear piece goes into the ear canal, stay anchored. Sound quality is great. The HS 810 would not hold a charge very long. So far so good with this Jabra --- it holds a charge while the Motorola needed to be charged all of the time.I like the vibrating feature when the phone ringer is turned off --- no need to share all that noise. As I am on call or expecting calls often when I am out at dinner, this really makes it discreet rather than missing the call and playing telephone tag for awhile.Sound quality is better than the Motorola HS 810. Jabra seems to work well for those who have small ears and their ear cells make it adjustable.If you don't need the vibrating feature, try the new Jabra BT 500 which is an upgrade of the Jabra BT 250, charging can be USB cable which is great as you will not have to take another charger on the trip!I also have the Jabra SP500 which is a wireless speakerphone and it works great vs. the Motorola speakerphone which I returned. The Speakerphone power and power AC cords for the BT 250v are not compatible, so if you need to use both, you will need two charges, although they are small.'], ['This is the best bluetooth device I've tried.  It is lightweight, comfortable, easy to set-up, good sound clarity and it is a very well made and sturdy device.  There aren't flimsy parts that can break.The best thing is that the ear peace is fairly inconspicuous as it sits over your ear.  I really don't want to look like Janet Jackson in her Control video as I walk around town or the mall.The problem is in finding replacement ear gels.  They are not available on the Jabra site or on any other site.  I ended up back at Cingular (now AT & T) and they gave me a couple that they had in a drawer.'], ['After having replaced my 250 3 times at the verizon store I asked to be given the 250V instead of a 4th 250, they did and so far so good, I think Jabra knew the 250 had some defects , each 250 i had died (stopped pairing) in about 2 months, the 250V seems to have no problems and works much better with my Motorola V710.The fit is great, and the sound is good, could use better noise cancellation, but oh well, maybe in a future model. But overall , I like the 250V. I recommend it to anyone. Just roll your windows up if your driving, or you wont be heard by the other end of your call.'], ['I have several of these. I also have lots of bluetooth headsets. For those times where I can live with a wired headset (which is most of the time) I use this one. You can sit in a crowded restaurant and the person you are talking to thinks you are alone in a quiet office.Brilliant design that every phone maker should license and build in to their handsets.It has two microphones, one facing your mouth and one facing out. They are cross-connected so any sound that comes through both sides is cancelled. Only sound coming from your mouth is picked up.Stays in your ear without the loop, and seals the ear canal so well that I actually have to turn DOWN my volume.The earpiece is the same as the Shure e2c consumer-grade in-ear monitor (which I also own). So you are essentially getting 1/2 of a $100+ in-ear monitor for your phone. That means excellent sound quality. When combined with the best noise cancelling I've ever used, I can say that this is the best kept secret in telephony.I use this on my cell phone and on my land-line phones. No one ever knows where I am or what kind of phone I'm on.Highly recommended...'], ['I've had this unit for about a year, it acts as an ear plug on the ear I'm wearing it on, and I can hear my caller even in strong winds. The audio quality is great. Since the microphone sits directly in front of my mouth the caller can hear me just fine and many times they don't know I am in the car. Since it's a wired unit, there are no batteries to charge and it's always ready to go. If you don't mind things in your ear this is a great head set.Update: Moved to an I-Phone from my Palm phone. I had to get a 2.5mm adapter to 3.5, The phone does not see the headset most of the time and won't route calls to it. Same with Blackberry Curve. I hope sure will make a new model for these phones, I miss using it.'], ['Shure\'s QuietSpot headset is the best headset on the market, period. The only problem with it is Shure\'s coyness about how it works and why microphone placement is *absolutely crucial* when using it. Once you understand that, you understand everything you need to in order to want it more than you want anyone else\'s.The 'problem' with the QuietSpot--mentioned by other reviewers here--is not a failure of engineering or quality control, but one of emphasis in their documentation. Barring an actual defective unit (which will usually not work at all) there is nothing wrong with the QuietSpot that proper adjustment doesn\'t totally eliminate. I believe that Shure doesn\'t tell you this for fear of alienating technically unsophisticated customers. Since I have nothing to sell you, I am blissfully unconcerned with boring you and can write something useful. Please note that I write this on the basis of a close examination of a working QuietSpot and an educated layman\'s knowledge.Observation tells me that, Shure\'s QuietSpot headset uses active noise cancellation and it is the only cellular headset on the market that does.  This means that the mouthpiece of the headset uses two microphones: one takes in the sound from the world around you while the second takes in the sound from your mouth.Using  a trick of wiring, this dual-microphone arrangement uses the sound from the outside world and uses it to weaken the sound from the microphone closer to our mouth. Since both microphones take in surrounding sound, the strongest sound that *isn\'t* cancelled out is your voice.For this to work, the microphones need very good alignment with your mouth. The  QuietSpot demands that you have the \'mouth-side\' microphone pointed directly at your mouth, and the \'world side\' microphone pointed directly outwards without mis-alignments like having the microphone-housing too far below or two far above the side of your mouth, or having the microphone housing turned on its side.The tough part about this is that the boom that holds the microphone can twist and bend while the QuietSpot is in your pocket or case, turning the microphone head around onto its side. If the microphone-head is turned on it\'s side, or set too far above or below your mouth, then both microphones pick up your voice with equal intensity and the arrangement does exactly as it\'s supposed to: It treats *your voice* like background-noise and sends everything you say off into oblivion.The solution is easy and useful: you have to learn to put the QuietSpot\'s microphone in the right place every time you put it on. Once you learn to do this with the windscreen on, you have what is close to the perfect headset. I have used the QuietSpot, standing in bars in New York City with the jukebox blasting and not had to raise my voice very far above an ordinary conversational volume and with the QuietSpot\'s noise-blocking earpiece, I could hear my listener perfectly. The two-way noise elimination of a well-adjusted QuietSpot is amazing, providing a sense of intimacy and privacy in conversations that no other headset ever gave me including one or two that cost more.The only other thing you need to know about the QuietSpot is that it is particularly sensitive to wind=noise and unless you intent to never use it outside, it is best to keep the windscreen permanently attached to the unit. You can do this with a needle and thread through the foam, or with a thin-strand of wire. Once you\'ve done this, you\'ll have to learn to make the important adjustment by touch but even then, it\'s still easy.Now that you know all this, give the QuietSpot a try. You won\'t be disappointed.'], ['I did my research years ago when I purchased this off Amazon. It's been the best headset for all these years. It followed me through 2.5mm cell phones to 3.5mm cell phones with an adapter. Sadly, the other parties can no longer hear me with it. I even tried a new 2.5 to 3.5mm adapter with no luck. I'm looking for a new headset and there's NOTHING like this one. Shure had it right and I wish they still made it. Not everyone likes bluetooth where it's hard to hear and be heard. I can't believe there's nothing like this on the market anymore. Jabra all has bad reviews and I tried a Plantronics one and returned it. I'm mourning the loss of this headset and wish it'd magically work again.'], ['I drive a convertible and I have gone through 6 different hands-free devices that didn\'t work. Wind noise is awfully high with the top down, and my wife could never hear me when I talked on a hands-free. That is no longer a problem. The Shure works great! It is comfortable, clear sounding and best of all - I\'m audible when I speak. If it had a 'turbo' button, it would be perfect, but other than that - it is terrific. This is the best I\'ve seen...'], ['I was stunned. After 2 plantronics (a 320 and a 330) I was tired of earhooks that came loose and dropped calls. I thought it was my provider when my calls got dropped consistently in the same areas on my drive to/from work. But this headset is phenomenal! maybe one dropped call in a week... And the off/on operation is great! Open/close the boom to turn off/on! I love this headset... and I don't say that often'], ['This animal is fantastic. Fool that I was I was using a headset with a wire. Every time I turned me head the ear piece would fall out. If I did not turn me head I still had the feeling that this thing was just waiting to strangle me.I reluctantly went to the Motorola HS850 Bluetooth Headset to find what life could be without a wire. All I had to do was initially charge it. The phone did all the rest for me; it located the headset and immediately started to use it. I have it set for one ring tome just to alert me and then it answers. There is virtually no background noise so you have to say 'Hello'. The voice comes in clear and loud enough to use in noisy areas. However I just tell the caller to hold on and go to a more appropriate location if I am on foot. I do not want to be accused of being rude or talking to my self. When in the car the warning gives I time to turn the radio off and the caller can not detect that I am mobile. Again I try to make care calls curt or call back from a static location. Other mobile commuters do not get offended by me having a hand up to me ear as I change lanes with out signaling.I keep the phone on my belt but never have to pull it out. I seldom make out-going calls however the phone and the headset are designed to make voice dialing instructions and still not have to pull the phone out. At home I leave the phone on a book case across the room and the headset still works well. When I feel like being a recluse all I have to do is fold the headset and it is turned off.'], ['This is one of the better BT headsets that I own. You can hear at your end AND you ARE heard clearly at the other. Talk time is great standby time is great. I let my wife borrow it to see if she liked it, needless to say I have ordered another one for myself. MOTO keeps getting better.'], ['I'm not a Bluetooth techie, so I can't compare this to other headsets, but after a month of ownership, I can say it works great.My car has built-in Bluetooth, but everbody tells me that when I'm in the car it sounds like I'm under water.  Not so with the Motorola - I'm told it's crystal-clear.The only negatives I have are:* The multifunction button has no tactile feel - it leads you to press too hard, and too often.  This is especially a problem when yo're walking or driving.* The flip out mic is nifty, but the headset tends to wobble if you shake your head at all.'], ['I have a Siemens SX66 (yes, the PDA-phone that supposedly works with no Bluetooth headset out there), and I'm very happy with this headset.It's reasonably comfortable, has great sound volume, even in noisy environments, people say I sound clear even when in an automobile while driving, and it synchronized right away with the SX66.Most importantly, with the boom mic to flip, you can turn this unit on and off in a fraction of a second.  My SX66 recognizes the HS850 headset within a second (I'm at the latest Bluetooth v1.1 driver from Siemens/Microsoft - I tried applying the patch from Siemens' website, but the phone was already at the latest version).In short, everything works well, and the ambient noise cancellation features seem to work well, according to the people I'm talking to.I haven't run this to the point it has completely lost power - I don't know how long it lasts.  At least 3-4 days of idle and 4-5 hours of talk time.'], ['I was one of the lucky few to get one of these free for registering my Motorola MPX-220.  I was skeptical to the whole bluetooth scene, but this headset quickly changed my mind.The device will easily last 3-4 days in standby mode with average usage.  The sound is excellent, and people who listen think I\'m talking on a normal phone.  The range is great.  I can be about 50 feet away without a problem.The best part about the phone is the intuitive on/off.  When the microphone boom is 'folded' out, it turns on.  Fold it back in, and it turns off.  Simple, yes.  But many other headsets require you to push buttons (or hold them down).  This makes using it a snap!I actually have one for my home office and another that I leave in my car.'], ['I bought this product few weeks back. It works really great with my Samsung t609. Once you have bluetooth enabled on your phone, everything else works smooth.

I use it with a Motorola RAZR V3.My last Bluetooth headset was a Jabra, and it broke after just a few months -- the power button quit working, so it was always on until the battery drained.I love the HS850 since it has no power button!  Instead, you just flip it open or closed.  It gets great battery life, since it's so easy to put it in standby by flipping it closed.I have also used this headset successfully with Skype on both Windows and Mac.  The only catch is that it can only be active with one device at a time, so you have to disconnect/release it from your cell phone, before you can successfully use it with Windows or Mac.  This makes switching back and forth between your PC and phone a bit cumbersome.  Of course, it took a couple of hours to get it working under Windows, but it worked first try on the Mac ;-)'], ['IMHO this is slightly better than the Moto H700.  It's larger, and a bit heavier.  The boom is larger.  But if that's not an issue, then both are equal IMHO.  Both have the cheek problem!Now for the problem where people cannot hear you, or you sound muffled or away from the phone.  Wearing your bluetooth, look in the mirror and see how the boom touches your cheek or if you have a beard it'll touch that.  Note there is a very small hole on the inside of the boom that gets the sound.  Now anything that touches that will impede your voice....it's like putting a towel over a regular phone and talking to someone. Not you do not need puffy cheeks for this problem to happen.  Unless you have a very narrow face, chances are this will happen to you and yo'll blame it on the bluetooth!TO fix this, get either Neoprene tubing or that sticky foam on one end (mole skin) and cut a small piece and put on the hinge near the boom then a smaller piece (if needed) on top of the other.  This will make a space between your cheek and the boom so people can hear you! With this fix, you will still be able to close your boom.'], ['This wired Motorola RAZR headset is better than a Bluetooth one for these reasons:-the mic is closer to your mouth so your voice will sound better and clearer than a Bluetooth headset where the mic is way up by your ear. I tried a wireless Bluetooth headset and my voice always sounded distant and callers could hear ambient room noise around me. They said I sounded like I was using a speakerphone. But when I use this wired headset, they say my voice is quite clear and loud.-it's easier to just plug in this wired headset at any time than fool around with the settings for syncing with the Bluetooth when you want to by on headset.-This headset is easier to carry with you than a Bluetooth one and no AC adapater charger or battery is required.-This headset is cheaper than a Bluetooth headset and in fact comes bundled with some RAZR phones.The only reason I'm not rating this headset 5 stars is that I agree with other reviews, the earpiece doesn't fit that snuggly in the ear.

Together, these frequencies cover Europe, much of the U.S. and many other countries. Most tri-band units, however, are usually equipped with either 850 or 900mhz.850 fills in the 'rural gaps' in The States. 900 allows for roaming in New Zealand and Australia. Whereas both T-Mobile and Cingular operate on GSM frequencies and therefore can offer world phones, Cingular operates on the 850 and T-Mobile on 900. They allow each other to use their frequencies for instances where they don't provide a needed frequency... provided you device is equipped w/ both 850 & 900 mhz as is the Motorola V330.How is T-Mobile? Truth of the matter (as with any mobile phone service) it comes down to the region you live in as well as what building your in and the area that building is in. Sorry, there is no across-the-board answer. As soon as one gets great reception, his/her neighbor curses it.Visually, this phone is indistinguishable from just another flip phone, but it offers rather large and well-spaced keys. The screen is vivid and bright. The ringtone gets plenty loud. For these reasons, it's a great phone for seniors who still want a modern phone. I just got one for my mum.Of course, being a quad-band, video, camera, multi-zoom, bluetooth, infrared device w/ browser, the general ease of operation can only be so easy. That 'said,' many a senior probably couldn't be bothered w/ messing with it all or putting to test call quality in rural U.S. and New Zealand.That you get all of this and at such a price makes the V330 an eyebrow-raising steal.One more thing - That it's blue, not the de riguer black or silver, I like.A quality phone packed w/ a host of goodies. Go 'head on, Motorola.'], ['This is one of the nicest phones I have used.  It is a traditional flip phone for those who use their phone as a phone and works very well.'], ['I have been itching for a Treo ever since the 600 came out and I noticed that more streamlined design.  When smartphones were first introduced, I bucked the trend of combining the two thinking that as often as I use my cell phone and my pda, if I bought one that integrated both I would wear it out twice as fast.  And in my humble opinion, it was a valid reason because back then, the original phone/pda's were impossibly large.  Well I have finally become a convert.I spent a great deal of time researching Blackberry's vs. the Treo's vs. Pocket PC's and came VERY close to grabbing a T-Mobile Dash (which I still believe is the all-around smallest model availabe as I write this, or at least it SEEMED to be), but I finally settled with the trusted Palm OS platform (one that I have become VERY familiar with over the years using pda's for quite some time now).  When I set out to get one, I really had my heart set on the Treo 680...but as I read the reviews for them, one thing kept creeping in to almost all the reviews: battery life was terrible.  With that aside, quite a few of the reviewers mentioned that all things considered, they were more happy with their old 650.  I saw this on so MANY reviews that I began to think twice.  Then I noticed that the 700p was a more beefed up version of the 650, and began to consider it as well.  Unfortunately as I write this, it isn't available with Alltell service where I am (it will, but nobody can give me a target date, and dang it, I am too impatient to wait...) so I am right back with the 650.  It took a while before Palm was able to knock enough of the bugs out of the 650 that I felt like buying one would be worth it...and I am discovering more than a few bugs have been associated with both the 680 & 700p, so no matter HOW much time I spend considering upgrading to a newer model, I find compelling reasons to go right back to the Old School 650.Reason #1 to go with it: Since it is no longer available at Palm's Official website, and with the newer models coming out, chances are you can find some pretty sweet deals on the older 650.Reason #2: Virtually ALL of the problems originally associated with the 650 have been eliminated.  You want Push email?  You can get it.  You want web surfing?  No prob.  You want to view AND edit MS Word Documents and Excell?  Easier than ever with the 650 (that was one major plus over most of the Pocket PC's and ALL of the Blackberrys -- sure you can VIEW some of these documents, but you cannot EDIT them, too).Reason #3: No matter HOW convenient the pda, I found it next to impossible to give up a touch-screen's amazing versatility and the ease with which you can use it to edit things and connect on websites.One more important item to factor in when considering buying a 650: With the popularity with ever increasing wireless downloading speeds, I was afraid that the slower Treo would make internet surfing next to impossible because of the archaic speeds with which you are forced to endure.  I was VERY pleastantly surprised that downloading web pages did not take as long as I was at first expecting.  I have to tell you, after experimenting with the supposedly MUCH faster 700p with another online carrier than the one I was using (I won't say which, but they really did their best to tell me the 650 was slower than a dial-up modem from 1985), anyway, the 650 was only SLIGHTLY slower than this screaming fast 700p or the 700w.  I figured that was something I could live with to be honest.  Hey, it's a tiny hand-held device that allows me to send and receive email and surf the web...I'm still amazed that something like this exists at ALL to be honest with you...so downloading speed is still secondary in my opinion.  If speed really IS on your list of absolutes, maybe you ought to move up to something else...but keep in mind, it is only BARELY faster than what I experienced first hand.One more thing: the screen is amazing.  There are only so many ways to say WOW.  If you are considering buying a Palm that runs Windows Mobile, you ought to know that the screen clarity is almost reduced by HALF.  This apparently has something to do with Window's OS, and seriously put my decision to buy one on the back burner.Sure there are things that a smartphone cannot as yet do without some difficulty or impossibility...but that is the same with ALL current models.  Do some SERIOUS research into what you want vs. what you NEED and make an informed decision only AFTER you have had the chance to go into a store and test a specific model PERSONALLY.  Do that and no matter WHAT you decide on, you will most likely be happy.  So far, I know I am VERY satisfied with my choice.  Good luck on yours.***UPDATE***I opted not to get a Bluetooth hands-free device -- at first.  Originally I would see people walking around with these Lt. Uhura type thingy's sticking out of their ears and I couldn't help but wonder how lazy people are that they cannot raise their hand up to their head while walking around simply to talk on the phone.  For the most part I STILL feel this way, but I decided to buy a Bluetooth hands-free headset for while I am driving.  I cannot afford to miss calls, and being in radio, when not at work or home I can be found in my car monitoring the radio virtually 100% of the time and unfortunately this means I sometimes cannot hear the ringer.  The tethered device that came with the phone is certainly loud enough, but simply did not fit my ear (it kept falling out).  I bought a replacement that came with a variable size adapter and yet while it FIT better, the sound was almost impossible to hear (the worst I have ever experienced, actually).  So I took the plunge knowing full-well that the Palm Treo has a somewhat problematic history using these devices...so I made sure that I had an iron-clad return policy in place and jumped in.  It took me no more than a minute to configure my head-set and I went ahead and made a test call which had more than enough volume -- in fact it had plenty to spare.  All in all I am VERY satisfied with the performance. (I bought a Keycera Bluetooth, if that means anything)One additional item that requires mentioning: I currently have call-waiting as a service with my Treo and yet I have missed at least 3 calls (that I know of).  This particular feature does not seem to be supported by the 650...and IF it is, I have yet to discover any useful info regarding the problem, whether online or in the bible-sized instruction manual.  I will keep looking and IF I find a solution I will quickly report it here asap.  Just one more thing to think about.  Otherwise, I am amazingly satisfied with my Treo otherwise.  The ONLY thing I wish (other than user-friendly call-waiting) is faster downloads while online.  That is supposedly possible with the newer models using EVDO and yet the 700p I tested failed to work only slightly faster than my 650.  Maybe it was the network -- but not according to them (no surprise there).  I still think my purchase was WELL worth it.'], ['It's been two weeks with my Treo 650 and now I remember why I love the Palm OS so much. I switched to BlackBerry two years ago (7290) and I've enjoyed using it except for the very, very basic screen. I assume that's how they get such remarkable battery life. But, I've had to switch from the BB for work reasons and I'm very happily using Palm again. My last Palm was a Palm Vx and it's still alive and kicking after many, many years.The Treo 650's screen is really amazing. And, I've read the older reviews about the Treo 650 and the frequent resetting issue. I was certainly concerned and ready to send it back if I had problems (Cingular gives you 30 days to try it out). So far only one reset in two weeks with the Palm - honestly, I had to reset the BlackBerry constantly so I'm not sure I'd notice the difference. And, the BB resets are particularly annoying because they would happen at the start of answering incoming calls and then literally take 5-8 minutes to reset and let me use it again. I'm not sure why it took so long - I did have a big address book. The Palm reset only took 30 seconds.But, here's where Treo shines: screen graphics, photos, mp3s and videos. I can put 2-4 movies on a 2GB SD card, pop into the Palm and carry around some convenient entertainment. One little feature that really impressed me was the ability to display the screen vertically (it's longer that way). With letterbox movies it really increases the size of the video and exceeds the size of videos on my Zen Vision 30GB screen. And, the videos really look incredible.And, of course, there's a ton of free software out there for the Palm. So far, I've only downloaded TCPMP for the movies. The included RealPlayer is very impressive - yo're ready to listen to mp3s right out of the box.Final note: I've used the Palm Desktop for PIM stuff (contacts, calendar, to do's) off and on for years and I'm still impressed with it's features and easy/quick navigation. They've always been ahead of the pack - I know many of the newer phones come with similar PIM software so your PC can talk to your new phone but aside from BlackBerry no one else is even in the ballpark.You can manage photos in there as well and even add photos to your address book so once yo've synced up your incoming calls display a picture of the caller. I know this has been around for a while but it wasn't available on my old Palm V or the new BlackBerry I've been using for the past few years.'], ['As someone who used the original Palm Pilot and eventually the Handspring Visor with Visor phone, I thought off and on about buying the Treo 650. The very mixed, sometimes extreme, reviews of the 650 and the relatively high price for an unlocked Treo kept me away. With the release of the next generation of Treos drmatically forcing down the price of the 650 I decided to take a chance. After a week of fairly active use I have to say that I am extremely pleased with my new Treo. I bought my new unlocked (Cingular branded) Treo online. The phone clarity is as good as any mobile phone that I have owned. I have not had any dropped calls. The browswer and e-mail client that came loaded on my Treo work well. I live in a country where the fastest mobile data connection is still GPRS/EDGE, so my Tro 650 is just right. I easily synced my Treo with my MacBook with no problems. Over all for $225 + shipping and handling of $20 I have to say that this was a real bargain.'], ['I am in love with this phone!First off, the Palm functionality is wonderful!

I received  this one as a gift from my friend and love it for two simple reasons:1) The sound quality is excellent. Despite the fact that it is very noisy in my car when I drive on the highway, I still can hear excellent. I actually do reduce volume on the headset because it has more volume potential than I need. I tried two headsets by Motorola in the past, including HS850. They also have volume button but even when you set to the maximum volume you can't hear well if you in a noisy environment. Plantronics provide you great quality and enough volume for any noisy environment. Also, everyone whom I talked to, told me that they can hear me very well, just like I speak without the headset.2) Reason number two - it sits perfectly on the ear. It is easy to insert it when you drive, and once it in, it stays there. It doesn't move at all. Unlike Motorola headset, that does not fall off but it moves on your ear and it takes a long time to get used to the fact that it is not falling off your ear. Plantronics also provides three different sizes of the pieces that you insert to your ear, makes it perfect to fit any size or shape.That is all I have to say. There is a good headset out there.

It fits my ear perfectly, I can wear it for hours without noticing it, and it gives great sound. I had no problem syncing it to my iPhone, and although I haven't tried any other devices, I anticipate no problems.I only have two complaints:1. The on-off switch is very small and hard to use. I find that I have to push it with my thumbnail to make it work. If you have smaller fingers, you may have less of a problem.2. Plantronics uses a proprietary connector for charging, while other manufacturers are switching to mini or micro USB. A proprietary charging interface means one more wire to carry with me.In summary, a great purchase.'], ['This is a very good bluetooth headset, however I recently purchased a newer Plantronics as the sound quality and smartphone compatibility has changed since I bought this one.

Also, he said that it was too bulky for his liking, but I like it just fine!The sound quality is great, I can hear others well and I'm told that I come through very clearly.

Highly recommended for both the performance and price. Oh, contrary to another reviewers suggestion, it will not fit into a mint tin due to it\'s width.

The newer models appear to be riddled with minor bugs & issues, so why not stick with a winner? I\'m now using this with my T-Mobile Dash and it works great for the voice command features.

The multiple options for ear pieces, flexibility of the design (switching ears without carrying extra accessories), compatibility with lots of phones, antenna design solving cross body communications for some phones, charging options with USB and power (you can wear it while charging comfortably), and battery life all are great. It connects to 2 devices at a time though you can obviously only answer one of them at a time.The Bad: (all minor) The wind smart does not work that great.  I have yet to find a bluetooth headset that can handle direct wind noise and this is no exception. It does better than most but remote parties still complain. Every headset I have tested fails here. This is difficult to distinguish between mute on the headset and power off. I tuned it off a few times on accident when trying to mute.  Oops. The mute also does not alert you frequently enough that it is on, but you can still mute from the phone separately without issues.  Pairing is simple, but not just a one button option.I would suggest this headset to users looking for a good headset for most devices.

Sure, the battery life suffers after years of use, but they're so cheap that it's no problem at all to get a new one.My only complaint is that the blue light on it is extraordinarily BRIGHT. I can't charge this thing at night without covering it up because it's like a blue lighthouse in my room.  And when it's on, the flashing blue light is VERY annoying in dark rooms (e.g. watching a movie).

The case was the opposite when I was using Jabras, when I used to hear complaints about noise, static and low volume of my voice.2. Good and controllable earphone volume. It can reasonably well deal with traffic noise when I\'m walking outside my downtown Chicago office. I can set the volume really loud, so the only case when I cannot hear my partner is when I\'m walking too close to a moving train. My usual volume setting is around 1/3.3. This set\'s microphone tolerates wind better than the Jabras mentioned above which used to produce a great deal of wind noise whenever I was encountering a breeze. In addition, if I know I\'ll be outside in a windy environment I can put the included microphone sponge on.4. Good battery life. I don\'t have to charge it often.5. Although it seems very light and gentle in my hands, it handles everyday folding and switching between my shirt pocket and both my ears very well.6. No problems with long usage, unlike Jabra BT250, which used to irritate the skin on the back of my ear if I used it too long or too often.I never heard about Plantronics before buying this headset and I grew to appreciate it a lot more after years of usage. Only recently I discovered that Plantronics has a long history with headsets and that even the Apollo missions used their headsets on the Moon. Makes sense. 'One small set for man, one giant leap away from other BT headsets. Houston, we have no problem'.'], ['I bought one for work and used it for a year or more with no complaints, so I bought one for my wife and she uses it constantly and loves it.  Highly recommended.'], ['This has to be one of the best headsets out there, I have used many and this unit has to be one to beat. No issues whatsoever, great quality and easy to use..'], ['Very good sounding both ways but not usable in 18 wheeler. Mic is overwhelmed by the 75 to 100db of ambient background noise. Good noise canceling in other environments.Not good outside in wind even with new mic grill.'], ['This product has done alot for me. i've used it with multiple phones and even my PS3 and it has never failed on me. great quality headset! easy to use and to link to. dont regret buying it.'], ['I chose this product based on reading many reviews of Plantronics and Motorola headsets primarily on Amazon. I am very happy with my purchase. As others have said, most will never know you are on a headset. The battery lasts all day, so having a charger with me during the day has never been even remotely necessary. I've talked 3 or 4 hours some days, and had it on all day when I'm not talking, and have never run the battery down. I do charge it when I get home each evening. The volume is more than enough (and I'm a bit hard of hearing). It's comfortable so I just leave it on most of the time when I'm at work. It works equally well in either ear. It connects quickly and works great. Sometimes it seems a bit hard to get on, but other times it just slips into place. But we're talking sometimes it takes 10 seconds of fiddling to get it over my ear just right. Usually, it just slips on. I wear glasses and I think that's most of the issue there. Highly recommended and I would purchase this again w/o question.'], ['I have small ears and sometimes have to use this gadget for 8 hour conference calls.  For this reason comfort and battery life are paramount.  It stays pretty comfortable and the battery will go about 4-6 hours.  I think that's about the most you can expect from a bluetooth headset.'], ['I work for Verizon Wireless in their tech support department and I have yet to use a better Bluetooth headset. I've owned 4 over the last year; a Jabra, a Motorola, this one and another Plantronics. And I've used several different ones over time in the testing process, and this is easily the best I've used. The earlier Plantronics was also very good as well. The Jabra didn't have very good noise-reduction and the Motorola was a terrible purchase altogether. But this headset I can say with ease is superb. Great sound, it picks up very little in the way of ambient noise, and the charge lasts forever, seemingly!UPDATE: When I originally purchased this device over 2 years ago, I di have to replace it back in July. Why? Because I had it in a messenger bag that got stepped on. I used it just about every day, and the only reason I had to get a new headset is because it was physically damaged. Guess which headset I got to replace it? THE SAME ONE! If the previous one worked for over 2 years and only stopped working because it got stepped on, then this is the one I'm sticking with for as long as they make them.'], ['I first bought a headset for $30.  It worked well for about 10 (maybe 12) minutes and then fell apart.  So, I would not suggest considering anything under $100.Unless you consider this one.When I returned my first headset to Fry's Electronics I asked them what their most popular model was.  The sales guy said it was the Plantronics 510.  I tried it on and it felt really good.  I've been using it for about two months now and I love it to pieces.  It works as well now as it did the moment I bought it (actually, better, because it needed a charging).Positives:1)  Comfort.  This was the biggest attribute I was looking for as I wear this a lot.  After putting it on I usually forget it is there within two minutes.  It is light weight and very easy on the ears.  I only remember when somebody calls me and I hear the beeping in my ears.  With a flick of the wrist, this easily converts between the left and right ear and both feel extremely comfortable.2)  Sturdy.  I travel a lot and airports are not kind to any belongings, especially ones crammed into a bag.  But this thing has taken its lickings and keeps on going.  Must better than the first one I bought which fell apart over nothing.3)  Great sound quality.  I've used this at airports, casinos, and convention centers.  I can always hear my party without any problems and I've never had anybody complain that they can't hear me.4)  Simple to work.  Probably the most difficult thing about this is getting it recognized by the phone.  And that isn't complicated at all as that only took me 2 minutes, and most of that was searching for directions on how to do it.  Picking up the phone is as easy as hitting a button.On a side note, I have two Bluetooth cellphones and I can switch between the two automatically without any hassle.  Because of this ease of switching over I am considering getting the phone base so I can use this on my office line at home as well.  I know somebody who uses it and she has no problems with it.Negatives:1)  I wish there was a way to turn off the blinking blue light.  It drives me crazy especially while driving at night.  Half the times I see it blink I think  I'm getting pulled over.  Also, it keeps blinking whether you are using it or not so I usually cover it with a hand towel when it is charging at night.  But this seems to be inherent of any bluetooth device.2)  Ummmm.... I can't think of any other negatives.So, I highly suggest checking this one out.  I can't say that this is for everybody because I've learned that no two ears are exactly alike.  The biggest thing I was looking for was comfort.  While this is completely comfortable for me it might not be for you.  But if you find it comfortable then I would HIGHLY recommend picking this up over anything else especially since the price is soooo right.'], ['I have owned four Bluetooth headsets. This is by far the most comfortable and easiest to use. I have no problems with sore ears as with my other models (Motorola, Jabra BT350 and BT800) and sometimes forget that I am wearing it. Good sound quality, fits well, stays on no matter what. The perfect headset!'], ['I bought this on a reccomendation of a friend.  My brother bought a Motorolla earpiece for about $30 more than I paid for mine.  he hates his and I love mine.  Most people never realize I am talking to them through a headset.  You get 3 ear speakers of different sizes so you attach the one that is most comfortable for your ear.Best addition to my cell phone I have ever bought.'], ['Like most people I have purchased multiple Bluetooth headsets and struggled with poor reception, I can't hear the caller or they can't hear me.  This Plantronics Voyager 510 headset didn't have any of these problems.  The device simply worked and I have used it for years.The headset will operate for 6 hours of talk time and 100 hours of standby time and is ideal for me to use when traveling and especially when driving.  The noise canceling microphone worked well in that people could hear me but not all the background noise like wind or rain on the windshield.  The earpiece is comfortable to wear and is light enough that you forget you have it on.The headset has the feature to operate with two Bluetooth devices simultaneously and the smart technology feature connects you to the proper device with a touch of a button.  The headset boom swivels to fit the location that is best for you and even folds into a small form for easy storage.  The head set will operate up to 33 feet from your Bluetooth device so if your phone is in your briefcase or in the back seat of the car you can still take calls.The unit also features Adaptive Frequency Hopping to find a free channel to avoid interference from other WIFI/WLAN sources.  I have tried about 10 Bluetooth devices over the years and this one was simply the one that performed the best.'], ['I have been in the wireless industry for over 10 years. Ive tried but failed several times to find a GREAT bluetooth headset. Until I came accross this unit.To simplify- It works perfectly! No outside noise, its lightweight and comfortable.Most important, is that there is no outside interference.Its the best unit I have used to date. I bought two of them. One for my wife and myself.I highly recomend this unit!!Go get it!Joel'], ['Easy to set up and use, excellent sound quality, light and comfortable.  You can't go wrong for the price.'], ['No complaints here. Excellent sound quality - the volume can be turned up nice and loud. Fewest 'bluetooth clicking noises' of any bluetooth device I\'ve used. Hardly hear them at all unless you walk to far away from the source.I have this Voyager 510 paired with both my Treo 650 and Skype on my laptop (using the Anycom USB 250 I reviewed previously) The headset picks up the call from whoever rings first every time. I love it!! Skype call comes in, and the headset rings - call comes in on the Treo 650 and the headset rings. What\'s not to like???I love the fit too - I think it\'s the best I\'ve tried on. I also have the Scala 700x which is about as light you could imagine in a headset. But, it\'s almost a little too light (and fragile). Honestly, I like them both but need to have a backup. Now that I think of it, I believe my wife just inherited a Scala 700x.The 510 feels like it\'s built to take some abuse which I think is a plus and yet it\'s lighter than I expected - to be honest. It\'s been around for a little while so I was afraid it might be a little heavy. I\'m pleasantly surprised that it\'s very light. I mean the fit is so perfect, you could go running while wearing it or certainly work out in the gym without any worries.I haven\'t put the 'wind cancellation' to the test yet but I will and then I\'ll update this review. But, honestly, when I saw all the positive reviews here on Amazon (1200 or so?) and many of them Treo 650 users, I figured it was a fairly safe bet and I\'m very satisfied with the purchase so far.The Scala works great with the Treo 650 too. It\'s hard to tell which one sounds louder - I\'ll experiment a little more and then write in once I have a winner.'], ['This is my second headset replacing the Motorola one that came with my cell phone.  People I call tell me that the sound is very clear on their end and cannot tell that I am using the headset - sounds just like I am talking into the phone.  That was not the case with the first one. I travel a lot and wear the headset for long periods.  My ear does not get tired or sore from having it on.  The headset seems well balanced and never seems like it is going to fall off regardless of what I am doing.  I also like that it folds flat for easy carrying in my shirt pocket.'], ['Wonderful bluetooth headset.  Great sound and minimal background noise for those on the other end of the phone.  Connected easily to my Sanyo Katana II cellular phone as well as my bluetooth USB device for both use with both my Skype and Vonage talk accounts.  Only complaint, the volume control could be easier to adjust.  I end up using the the volume control on the phone which is a bit easier and I can see where the level setting is at.'], ['Let's just get down to it.  If you are reading this review because you are shopping for a new Bluetooth headset, just go ahead and finishing reading the next couple sentences and then you can do what I did... buy the Plantronics Voyager 510 at Amazon (for under $45.00 as of this review).  I own 10 different headsets and have used them all to make hundreds of calls in all types of environments, and since we can only really rate products on a curve, there is currently no better choice at this time (things will no doubt change one day).  It is the most stable, the most ergonomic, the most static free (there is no such thing as a completely static free wireless product), the most efficient with it's battery usage, most comfortable (a somewhat subjective attribute), the most bang for the buck, the most satisfying to use, and the most 5 star rated Bluetooth Headset money can buy.  I can only really complain about one thing... a very sensitive microphone that will pick up wind noise in moderately windy conditions (in spite of the noise cancelling technology), but this is certainly true with every headset that I have used and probably true with ALL headsets when you come down to it.'], ['Simply awesome, the best one I ever had, sticking to this one after 1 motorola, 1 nokia and 1 samsung.'], ['Great Bluetooth headset. This is my second one - the first was stolen so I purchased one just like it.'], ['I purchased this for my self to use with my Motorola V3XX. I got home on the delivory day to find that my husband had fallen in love with it. He had allready paired it to his Blackberry. I had to purchase this one for my self. I have had only one problem and my husband has the same one. We are not able to walk more than 10' from my phone before we get the crackeling sounds and loose the ability to communicate with the person on the phone. We love the sound quality! We love the quality we get on he other end. The person on the phone says it all sounds great.'], ['Having had the Motorolla HT850, I liked its light weight and ease to turn on but it was never loud enough for driving.  The Plantronics 510 is very loud and fits well. My only negative is the small power on switch.  All in all, I vote for the Plantronics'], ['I have owned over a dozen different models of bluetooh headsets.  This is the best sounding and most comfortable of all of them so far.

It worked as well as I had hoped.'], ['Reader,I've had Sony Ericsson, Logitech Mobile Freedom, Cario Scala 500, Plantronics Discovery 640, and finally this Voyager 510.  Let me just say that my prior favorite was the Logitech but it was a little bulky and it disconnected from my phone after most calls (annoying).Having said that I now enjoy Plantronics Voyager 510.  The higher model, Discovery 640 doesn't stand a chance.  Yes the 640 is smaller, cooler-looking, but the features are not good.  The 640 has no windguard, no noice-cancelling tech, and the talk time is short.  The extra battery charger they give you and try to say that it boosts talk time does not.  You can't talk and charge at the same time.  Sheesh.OKay, so now with the Voyager 510, I love it.  Great fit.  It seems Plantronics has come out with a new version of the 510.  The foam mic boom is not removeable but is built in much like the logitech is.  The voice and sound quality are top notch.  I've recorded myself and it sounds clear.  I can even notice a difference with the noise-cancelling technology as the tv was on in the background, but my voice was still clear.  Noice-cancelling is important.Pros:Clear, audible soundMic is sensitive and my voice for callers are clearWind-GuardNoise-Cancelling technology (must have!)Fit - stays on confortably and they give 3 earphone-like inserts (perfect)Cons:the only thing is that the mic boom seems to rub up on my cheek or is very close so sometimes it will make a scratching sound for the caller (since it's rubbing against my cheek).  I haven't heard that complaint from other reviewers here so maybe it's unique to me.  I don't have big cheeks so I don't get it.'], ['I wasn't sure if I wanted to purchase another bluetooth headset because the last one I purchased, a Motorola HS815, was terrible.

I will give you some pros and cons:Pros:ClarityEase of UseBattery LifeVery Comfortable to wearDoes Not Fall OffThe only con is, I sometimes have difficulty intially putting it on becasue I wear glasses.

I hesitated to buy this one, despite the great reviews, because I wanted one that didn't give me the 'telemarketer' look. Top things I was looking for were: sound quality, comfort, and battery life. This unit delivers on all 3 counts. It sounds fantastic, it's really comfortable (especially with the Jabra EarGels on the ear piece), and the battery lasts a long time.

It mates easily to my Treo 650 and also to my Bluetooth-enable laptop, which makes it possible to use the laptop for VoIP calls.  Reception is good, volume is adequate and the people I talk with say that my voice is clear.  The controls are a bit stiff, as others have said.  But that means they have good tactile feedback -- you know when you\'ve pressed a button.One marginal shortcoming: the 510\'s clarity isn\'t good enough for it to replace the wired Plantronics USB headset I use for dictating to Dragon Systems 'Naturally Speaking' voice recognition software on the laptop.  But that would be a stretch for any wireless headset.Prices vary widely; shop around.'], ['This is the best product I have gotten for my cell phone and I have had many of these blue tooths.

It sounds better than my phone itself.'], ['I've had this for 2 years now and am pleased with quality, durability, and reliability. It is surprisingly comfortable considering the girth of the piece that goes over and behind the ear. My past headsets with earloops were horribly painful after a very short time, this one I can wear for hours, barely noticing it. It came with 3 different earpieces - one small, one large, and one teardrop shaped - so fit was not a problem. Sound quality is good enough that people frequently comment on how clear I sound and I am nearly always using it in the car. Wind cancellation really is insufficient, but this has not been a major issue for me...I just use it with the windows up or mostly up. I frequently leave this thing on overnight and still use it for a couple of days afterwards with no loss of power. Talk time is at least the 6 hours claimed and stand-by time can be measured in days.  Some people are troubled by the proprietary power cord, but it's a small matter as I have a household-type plug in my car and charge it while driving if need be, though it cannot be charged and used simultaneously.  I came here to see if I wanted to upgrade to another Plantronics model and pass this headset on to my daughter, but I think I'm going to keep it and buy her the same model.UPDATE:Still a 5 star item and I am on my second one.  After 2.5 years the first one broke at the top of the earloop.  I taped it with sports tape and kept using it without any problems, but I figured it was only a matter of time before it didn't work anymore so I replaced it. Others have said that the new 510s are junk, but I've been using mine for about 5 months now and it's exactly as great as the original.  The broken one is still working, too.'], ['Update 11/11/2008My wife's died about two weeks ago.

Awesome customer service. Just one more reason to get this product!I have used this for a month, and I love it. I have been searching for a decent bluetooth headset, and after using it for about a month, I can tell you it is great. The sound is very good and clear. I have no complaints from anyone I speak with, and usually they don't even know I am using a headset. There are only two negatives, and they really are not that bad. First, turning it on and off is not easy. That is not really a bad thing, but it is a little awkward. My second complaint would take off half a star, and that is, my usb car charger cannot work with it, and I had to buy a seperate charger. It is much easier to answer and hang up, when compared to others I have used. It is VERY comfortable, and I sometimes forget that I am wearing it., as witnessed by my wife who often reminds me tha tI am still wearing it. I bought this because my wife's set died and she needed a new one. Ehem, it seems that I somehow ended up with this one and she got my old piece of &$#%(@ (insert your guess of brand here) because she was used to it. Well, she now has her own and loves it as well, though she also complains about the on/off button.

But, with the new CA law regarding phone use in the car, I needed one which could switch between two phones. This does just that and it does it remarkably well.Although you cannot switch while in a conversation very easily (you have to hold the call button until it beeps twice to release the call to the phone mic/speaker and then could pick up the call, but have no easy way to switch back), it handles the obvious uses well. If one phone starts ringing, the headset correctly selects it so you can pick up the call - perfect.The headset is comfortable for very long calls, with a good balance on the ear.The microphone stalk is not as movable as the product brief suggests, and it does not fold up per se (sticks out no matter where positioned). Folding up the mic does not power off, which is a shame, although the battery life seems really good.Sound quality is good on the speaker and appears to be good on the other end, although I have not heard the other side to know for sure.Only downside vs. the Jabra is that it does not have a USB charger (small cord to plug into laptop when traveling), so you have to drag along the transformer.'], ['The Plantronics Voyager 510 has been an absolute work horse for me for the past nearly 2 years.

I used it in a weekly 4 hour commute, during the day in the office, at night to talk to my family from the hotel and a number of other usages.  I know this device and using it is as familiar as turning on my blinker in the car.The Good:1. Great noise filtering.  The microphone does a great job of filtering out ambient noise including wind.2. The battery is excellent and lasts for days on standby and for at least 6 hours talking.3. Multipoint Technology.  This technology rocks.  I have both my work (Blackberry) and personal cell phone synched with this device at the same time and can call or answer either without pairing hassles.4. Pairs with a device that it has been setup with by simply pressing the primary button.5. Volume buttons on earpiece.6. Comes with multiple earpieces for comfort.7. Stable in the ear.  It doesn't feel as if it will fall out.8. Durable.  I used this hard for a few years and it has only now started to fall apart.  Still works though.9. Shares common power supply with many other Plantronics devices for ease of power sharing.10. Larger then competitors but very light.The Not so Good:1. It is bigger then most other devices.2. The earpieces are prone to fall out and don't stay secured after about 6 months.As you can see I really don't have much bad to say about this device.  I am only now replacing it after 2 years of use and that is because the earpiece fell out and I can't find the pack that came with it.  It still works!

I used to just stuff it in my purse without a special case or protection, so I am not surprised it finally gave in. I see this product being sold for a lot of $$$ now, but I don't think I paid more than $40 for it. So it was a great deal and a great value.

In fact, they say it's clearer than if I were on a wired earpiece.  My problem with dropped calls has plummeted to almost nothing because I now position my phone in a decent area and talk wherever with this Plantronics BT.This is an ugly headset compared to others, but it works!

I use it with a Motorola i870 Nextel phone.  The headset works great, sometimes it disconnects for a moment and I just press the button on the side of the headset and it reconnects.  The talk time is awesome and I have gotten almost 5 hours continuous talk time out of the device.  The range isn't too bad I think I can get about 30 feet from my i870.  If only my crappy Nextel phone could keep up will the quality of the headset.  Since my i870 battery goes dead in like 1 1/2 with the extended batter pack I have to plug it in to charge.  However, while it's plugged in I can still use the 510 and wander all over the house and still talk on the phone.  It almost replaces the phone if I could dial from it.  The best part is that when you get too far away it gets a little static so that you know to come back closer and then the sound quality clears up.  Everyone I have spoken with on the headset says it sounds very nice and clear.Overall I would suggest this headset to anyone because it works, it's cheap and it wears extremely comfortable on your ear.'], ['I've had this earpiece for years and it still works as well as it did on day one . Never had any problems; never falls out my ear. Sound is great.'], ['Ever since i bought this headset I have become a fan of it. Its so comfortable I can wear it whole day without even feeling anythin is on, voice is crystal clear and its very easy to use. It pairs perfectly with my nokia 6610 as well as with my Dell Laptop so i use it for both VOIP calls and mobile phone calls. Also the service was great. I received the package right on the estimated date and never had to followup with anyone. A Superb Product !!!'], ['It is very difficult to find a Bluetooth headset that will work well with the Palm Treo.  This one does.  It has good quality sound and does not cut out.'], ['I've owned and used several different models over a couple of years, and the 510 is hands down the best I've used so far.  Battery life is excellent, fit is excellent, sound quality and mic quality is excellent.  Got mine when the price temporarily dipped to under $40, cannot beat it at this price.  Highly recommended.'], ['I gave one of these away 2 years ago, when it failed to stay paired with my BB Pearl.  Decided to give it another try with my MotoQGlobal (ATT), and am thoroughly satisfied.  Reception is great, and there is an audible signal for every function, including receipt of e-mail or text messages.  Great purchase at just over $40!!UPDATE 8/5/2009: Just stopped working, with no warning.  Out of warranty, unfortunately.'], ['I previously used both the Motorola HS850 and the HS820 and had the same two problems with each.  Insuffcient volume and insecure attachment to my ear.  Whenever I moved, the motorola headsets wiggled and made me feel as if they were about to fall off.  They never did but it was still annoying.  The volume problem was in part related to this.  The contact with my ear wasn't very firm and the ambient noise that the headsets let in coupled with a relatively low volume meant that I had to press the headset to my ear to hear clearly.I have been satisfied with my Plantronics 510.  The choice of 3 interchangable ear cushions, great volume, crisp output and decent range make it unbeatable.  The battery life is somewhat less that the motorola headsets, but I purchased an extra charger for home.  The power button is small, but using it is  a minor problem that resolves with a little practice.  The sound is crisp and clear.  The range is as good or better than the motorola sets.'], ['This headset proved to be a very pleasant surprised after tryinga bunch of others.  Was definitely the most comfortable, hadgreat sound and actually fits in your ear.  Variable ear piecesare a great touch and this unit should fit larger ears better.Sound quality was very good.

Very good.'], ['I read a lot before buying this headset and was kind of nervous because some bad reviews I read but I must say it was worthy because this headset is really good, I can hear perfectly when using it, it doesn't hurts my ear or anything, I don't use it like everyday so the battery has last for almost a week so far. I have a samsung captivate and didn't had any problem pairing it and using it.5 stars!'], ['For several years I used a Logitech Bluetooth for my cell phone, and while it worked great, it was always uncomfortable. When it snapped in two, I decided on the Voyager 510! Wow, not only does it work great, but it is VERY, VERY COMFORTABLE! In fact, I can honestly say I actually forget that I am wearing it, something I cannot say about my previous device. So for all of you thinking of a headset, you cannot go wrong with this one! Five stars!'], ['The Voyager 510 is very comfortable to wear and was easy to setup. The speaker volume is good with little or no static. Plus the it doesn't look like a block of plastic hanging off your ear. I highly recommend this headset.'], ['Over the last 2 years, I have tried over 10 different models of bluetooth headsets from different manufacturers. By far, Voyager 510 has the best all around performance - clarity, loudness, battery standby time, pairing, static free, ...If I have to pick one negative thing to say it would be the size.  It is quite a bit bigger than some other competing products but it is a small prize to pay for its superb performance.Get one, yo'll be glad that you do.'], ['I've tried several different Bluetooth headsets from Motorola and Cardo, and ended up returning or giving away all of them. I kept the Plantronics 510 because it is simply the best I have ever tried. I hear no static, cracks or pops, the audio quality is tops both for me and the caller, and it's comfortable and doesn't flop around on my ear like other headsets do when I move.While the Plantronics may seem slightly larger than other headsets (mainly because it has a larger part that goes behind the ear), it is very comfortable to wear and use, and is very light. It slips into a pocket or bag just as easily as any other Bluetooth headset.The Plantronics 510 comes with 3 different sizes of earbuds to fit your ear perfectly and the speaker goes in (or very close to) your ear, unlike other headsets where the speaker just rests on the outside of your ear which is really not good for getting high volume in windy/noisy environments.  Also the Plantronics has a boom mic that folds down partway towards your mouth. This is way better than headsets where the mic is way up by your ear because the closer the mic is to your mouth, the better you will sound and the less background noise the callers will hear. Everyone I've talked to using this Plantronics have raved at how good I sound, especially compared to the crappy Motorola's I've tried previously.The Voyager 510 has great battery life both while talking and on standby. The Bluetooth range is superb-I can very effectively walk all around my condo from room to room, talking on the phone, yet my cellphone remains on my computer desk-it really goes 30 feet, and through walls too.  And the fact that this headset can even remember pairing with multiple devices is icing on the cake.I really recommend this headset. It's money well spent. Or go ahead and try others, but it would be my educated guess that you will end up with this one eventually, like I did.*There is a slightly misleading bit of text in the instruction manual with regards to charging that you should be aware of: It states that the LED will illuminate Red while charging and illuminate Blue when done charging. However it actually blinks red while charging and turns solid Blue when complete.'], ['Tried many, but this one is only one I can use while driving noisy truck.'], ['We have three identical phones and three different bluetooth headsets. A Plantronics Explorer 320, a Motorola H350, and this Plantronics Voyager 510. Of the three, the Plantronics are superior in comfort and sound quality, and the 510 is outstanding in both respects. Although a little bulkier than the others, it is much more comfortable and my callers and I actually feel it sounds better than using the handset. As a result, I don't use the handset unless I have to!'], ['On the strength of the very high rating and huge reviewer feedback here on Amazon, I bought this Bluetooth device -- my first bluetooth headset ever.  I finally have a phone that has Bluetooth capability, and I was keenly interested in a wireless headset that wouldn\'t have the cord tangle issues of corded headsets.This device does exactly what I wanted it to do.  It was a piece of cake to setup on my Verizon Samsung u540 phone.  You wouldn\'t even need to crack open the user manual except to discover the 4-digit code you have to plug-in to your phone (it\'s 0000, btw).  After that, it\'s a snap to turn on and link to my phone.My other important concern was voice clarity, both on sending and receiving.  Thus far, after several hours of use, I can tell you that the voice reception I hear is crystal clear.  No crackling, no hollowing or echoing.  On the other end, I\'ve not had anyone complain about being unable to hear my voice or that my voice is coming across muddled -- interestingly, I\'ve had such complaints while using my old, corded headset!The power button *is* small and it *is* a tad more difficult to depress than you might want, but then, you won\'t accidentally turn on or turn off this device because of the way it\'s designed.  I agree with others -- turn on the device before putting it on your ear, and do the same when you\'re turning it off.As for noise canceling, my wife and I tested out this device in very noisy home with four small kids, and I was very pleasantly surprised at how well this headset communicated my voice but not the ambient noise in the room.Using the volume control on the headset was pretty easy to do.  Note that you can control voice volume either through the phone handset volume control or the control on this Plantronics headset.  If other reviewers are complaining about low volume from this headset, it\'s likely because one of the two volume controls is turned down too low, or perhaps the mobile phone their using doesn\'t have much by way of signal output.  This Plantronics headset has *plenty* of loud volume if that\'s what you want.As for ear comfort, I found it to be very comfortable, although I haven\'t worn it all day long.  I talked to a friend for an hour yesterday, and I had absolutely no discomfort at all.  The device comes with three earpieces (small, medium and large).  I use the medium with great results.The phone fits snuggly on my ear and it doesn\'t move around at all, although I\'m not jogging or even walking much while using it.I like the more discreet look of having the 'guts' of this device behind my ear, with a thin microphone on the side of my face, rather than the fat Motorola designs.Other reviewers have cautioned about the headset breaking, so I just take very gentle care while handling it.  I suspect I won\'t have a problem with it falling apart.I can\'t speak to battery life, because after a lengthy phone call, I just recharge it so it\'s ready for the next call I might make.  Charging it is easy to do and doesn\'t take long, either.In sum, I\'m very satisfied with this device.  As long as it doesn\'t break, it\'s performance and comfortable design make this an excellent choice.'], ['I bought this RAZR v3 phone in July to go with my 7-Eleven Speak Out Wireless prepaid service.  The phone I received from Amazon.com was made for the Hong Kong market, so it came with a outlet plug adapter for U.S. customers.  (The AC adapter itself is universal voltage, and the slim paper manual is in English.)  The phone is quadband and fully unlocked, so it can be used anywhere in the world.I really like the RAZR phone.  It's very solid and the voice quality is excellent.  Speak Out Wireless runs on AT&T; and T-Mobile networks so the reception quality can vary, but overall the RAZR does an excellent job in pulling in as much signal as possible.  As with other Moto phones, the brightness of the screen can be adjusted, and the ringer type and volume can be easily changed.  The metallic keypad takes a little getting used to, but is pretty comfy to use.The camera is only VGA but takes good-quality pictures when there's plenty of light.  Video capture is jerky and limited to 15 seconds, so that's probably the weakest feature for me.  Bluetooth linkup to a Sony Ericsson earpiece works fine.  Battery life is admirable; I don't use the phone much, maybe just 10 minutes a week, and I need to recharge it once every 8 days or so.Because I've owned many Moto's before so I like the RAZR's interface, since it feels familiar, but I can understand how it can confuse users new to the Moto scene.  Overall, though, I don't think it's harder to use than a Sony or Nokia.What really impresses me is the build quality of this phone.  Nowhere can you find out where this thing is made, but the material and fit and finish are excellent.  I'm very happy with this inexpensive purchase.'], ['I have been with this RAZR for a few days, but it has been working great. Setup is really easy. It has good reception, feels sturdy, and price from Amazon was really good.

Unlocked phones rules!!!'], ['I thought to come write this review because it is the 2 year anniversary of me buying this phone. I have never had any protective cover or case on it and it is still not very scratched up and it works as perfectly as when I got it. I had to replace the battery at 18 months but it cost $10 with shipping online for a genuine Motorola battery. Every other cell phone I have had has broken in some way long before 2 years. I'm amazed it is still in such great cosmetic and mechanical shape. No reason for me to get a new phone anytime soon.'], ['This is my fourth consecutive Motorola phone. I've owned a Timeport, v66, and v600. The Timeport was simply terrible. The v66 was a little better, but the Motorola menu had to be the worst of any phone I had ever used. My v600 was a very pleasant surprise. My sleek and functional RAZR is the best phone that I have owned. I really like the large crisp screen. The tiny external screen is a great addition. After three weeks of fairly heavy use, I haven't had any problems. The RAZR has pretty good talk time, but I'm not certain whether or not one can really get the 7 hours claimed by Motorola. The feature that I really like and appreciate is the abilit to charge my phone with a standard USB cable.

BackupBuddy VFS by Blue Nomad - back up the apps on your Treo.4.  Blocks by Electron Hut  - free Tetris Clone5.  ChitChat Lite - a free MSN Messenger client6.  Froggy by Tim Smith - Frogger clone.7.  Galax by Tim Smith - Galaxian clone.8,  PacMan by Horaco Ho - Duh.9.  Pocket Tunes by NormSoft - great MP3 and internet radio player.  Much better control over the audio than the included real player (which only plays MP3s, not internet radio).10.  PDANet by June Fabrics - Allows you to connect your laptop to your Treo and use the internet.  Works great.11.  FileZ by Nosleep software - your basic file manager for the Palm OS.12.  Voice Dial - download - dial calls using the sound of your voice.  Free to say numbers, but must buy to dial by name.13.  Pocket DVD Studio - allows you to compress DVD movies so that they can fit on a SD Card, making your Treo a movie player.'], ['I agree with the other poster. Why blame the phone because you broke the screen. Is the monitor at home bad because you dropped it off the table. The phone is the best smart phone out there.

Ignore the guy who broke his phone...this is a very good phone.'], ['This is my first 'smart phone' so I can\'t compare this to previous models.  However, I can tell you that it is great for what I need:1.  Great wireless service coverage.  Verizon has the best coverage of any provider.  I even have a signal in elevators and stairwells.2.  Text messaging.  My job requires me to carry a pager.  With this phone, I have forwarded my pager.  Now I only carry one device.  It is great for responding to pages or initiating message dialog.  I have 1,000 messages on my plan, and that should be plenty.  It is very handy to be in meetings and be able to ping people back at their desk for information.3.  Organizer.  I installed the software on my PC at work, and now my Outlook calendar is available wherever I take my phone.  One thing I didn\'t like was the lack of options on the initial sync.

It was a 'free' phone and the phone company wished they could nickel and dime us forever through their 'plans' and and make us pay various monthly service fees for the privilege of downloading a couple of songs or uploading photos or videos we made using the phone's camera. The Sony Ericsson's phones lacking a standard USB interface is probably intimidating enough to persuade most users to succumb to the phone company's demand of an extra $10 or more per month for 'web' access. But it does not need to be this way.Since we only wanted a phone that made phone calls this inexpensive wire allows us to squeeze some extra functionality off our free phone by allowing us to transfer media files in and out of the phone by connecting it to a computer. It's easy, it requires no software installation and we don't need to pay one extra dime to the phone company for the privilege.Positives:- eliminates the need to pay the phone company for an Internet connection- no software installation required- file transfer is actually faster- allows for easy media files transfer to and from OUR computer - all DRM-free files can be easily send to the phone- even users who have an Internet plan may appreciate the ability to connect their phone directly to their computerConcerns:- some minimal computer skills are expected - such as the ability to recognize specific file types and copy or move them to/from specific foldersConclusion: recommended to any Sony Ericsson phone user, with or without a media or Internet plan.'], ['You can use this to charge your phone with your laptop/pc.

On the other hand, I've heard that all bluetooth devices with same standard (i.e. version 1.2) should have no compatibility problem. It turned out to be absolutely smooth when connecting to my Samsung. The headset can flash and even vibrate when call's coming.The headset is amazingly light weight. You can't even imagine a lithium battery is sitting in such a leather-weight body that can hold on for 7 hours' talking.I spent $10 on this headset and couldn't be more happy.'], ['Your first question is what other headsets am I comparing this to. See my reviews of the Motorola HS850, Jabra BT250v, Plantronics 320 Explorer for reference. Now let's consider this headset in terms of the four key performance categories: pairing, sound quality, ease of use, and comfort.Pairing - I was able to pair this headset with my LG VX-9800 on the first try. The instructions in the manual are straightforward so I will not repeat them hear. The experience is similar to what I had with the BT250v.Sound Quality - This is really the top area to question with a headset. I'm happy to report that this headset delivers nicely in this area. I am able to use less than the max volume setting in most cases which is definite progress over the other headsets I have used. On the other end, it is important that you don't have the volume louder than you need it because otherwise people hear an echo of themselves due to the close proximity of the speaker to the microphone. However, I have found the echo to be less of an issue than it is on the HS850.Ease of Use - The key to a Jabra headset is holding the multifunction button down until it flashes. This turns the headset on and off after pairing. You will hear reports of people winding up redialing the last number called when trying to turn the headset off. If you don't wait for the flash, this will happen. I've also heard this reported during pairing, but that shouldn't be the case because you start pairing with the headset turned off. Finally, the volume buttons are easy to use. I only use the headset on my right ear so I can't speak to what it is like when the headset is flipped over and the buttons are on top.Comfort - I also found this headset to be the clear winner in the area over the other three that I have used. I wear glasses so the over the ear hook is a necessity. I think that they have also hit the sweet spot on placement of the speaker. The speaker is raised from the surface of the headset as opposed to the HS850 which is flush with the main body of the headset. However, it does not go into your ear like the BT250v or the Plantronics 320. I guess another way to put it is it rests just outside of the ear canal so the speaker is as close to being inside your ear without actually being so. I think that this maximizes comfort and contributes to the better sound quality. Finally, the vibrate feature is very disturbing if you are not used to it. Don't let that stop you though because it is something that you can turn off if you so desire.'], ['Very comfortable to wear, good reception, price of ~$22 plus shipping was unreal.  I prefer this style over the Star Trek earpieces, but this one's boom mic extends further out from the ear than other models in this series.'], ['I bought this phone ofr my in-laws a few months ago and it works great.  Unfortunately, I don't get to see their phone very often.  Unless there is something better, this will be my next phone.'], ['One person said in a review 'While this phone is thin, it is too bulky to handle, and seems flimsy.'I could not disagree more. It feels extremly sturdy, and while it is not a tiny phone, it is very thin. It weighs more then you would expect, but I don\'t mind because it feels a bit more well made.I had an off version of the Motorola V557 that I have had for well over a year now. I got it free, so I gave it up to a friend who needed a phone badly. I am a cingular customer. I was wanting a new phone anyways and it worked out well.I got the Nokia 6102 about one or two weeks ago. I have to say while it is a good deal for the price I just didn\'t like it at all. So I returned it and got the razr. I spent a bit more on the razr, but it was reasonable. (...).The razor is simple phone, a good phone. It comes in a very pretty case that will make you happy each and every time you open it! It has a good quality camera (it\'s NOT a digital camera, its more like good quality web cam) and I find it very easy to read, and dial because everything is so clear and spaced out nicley.I got the black version, and I nick named it KIT after the night rider car, it reminds me of it. Yeah I am a dork!I had read some complaints that this phone didn\'t come with enough stuff, well at it\'s launch price point I would say yeah it was overpriced. Now it has come down and it is a good deal in my book.I am very pleased with it so far! Pleased enough to come write a review!I also love all the cool accessories you can get, including vynle(sp?) skins in any color you want.'], ['I purchased this item a while back, but I remember that it was great item.  I would definitely recommend it. After 10 years, I still have ATT.'], ['I personally think the Black Edition RAZR phone looks really cool, better than the regular silver version.  The phone is otherwise identical to its silver twin... but, really, it just looks so cool -- and yo'll differentiate yourself from The Crowd.The phone is very capable and packed with features.  Unlike some high-end Moto phones from a year or two back, this one works very well and has a decent interface.  Everyone I know who has this phone simply loves it.[...]'], ['Oct 7th 2005If you look carefully at these so called 'bad reviews' you will notice most of them either don\'t know how to use the phone OR may have been the 1-2 out of 1000 that received a faulty phone which happens from EVERY manufacturer, EVERY brand, EVERY type of phone.Now my wife & I have had ours for 12 days so far with no problems whatsoever, we ordered 2, I got the Black one she got the silver one. Got BOTH for FREE btw.Just a word about those of you like us that want a 'shared plan' from Cingular BUT Amazon does not offer those plans while you order, I ordered 1 phone with 1 cheapest single plan each, now when Amazon sends you the conformation that your order has been shipped you get your 'Cell phone Numbers' right then in the email.I simply called Cingular gave them the phone numbers of each phone told them the deal and had the service changed to a 'single 700 rollover mins shared plan' before we even got the phones in our hands, so there is no problems at all in that respect. Once we got the phones I called back to check and yes the person from Cingular had done everything as asked, I also checked from the phone itself as you can go to 'My Account' from the Main Menu page and phone goes online and checks everything about your account, how many minutes, the plan, when the next bill is due, etc etc, and sure enough everything was as it was supposed to be.As far as signal strength it is excellent in my area, I can go all through our house upstairs and downstairs and it stays between 4-5 bars, I don\'t recall seeing less than 3 bars all around town so far, the phone gets a great signal, and Cingular 'in my area' puts out a great signal.My wife just came back from a business trip, she was about 150 miles away 'With NO ROAMING charges' btw our last cell phone service 'Alltel' would have been roaming within 20 miles.Anyway when she got to the hotel she called we both had perfect signal strength, we both put phone in 'Speaker Phone' mode and she just laid the phone in closed position on the night stand while she unpacked her suitcases, I put mine on my night stand and we talked for about an hour with no problems at all, and it was a FREE call 'Mobile to Mobile'.We sent a couple text messages to each other that worked no problem.She used the phone as her Alarm clock the next morning which worked perfectly.Now as for what 1-2 reviewers have said about the battery life, most likely they have gotten one of those 1-2 out of 1000.I\'ve had phone 12 days have charged it 3 times and have never let it go to the point where is says it 'needs' charging, so average 4 days per charge and just like the manual states it appears as though battery life is getting a bit better after a few charges, So I\'m easily going to get 3-5 days per charge, and that\'s with a lot of fiddling around with it because it\'s new and 1-2 hours talk time.Some one mentioned they dropped the phone on its hinge and it broke. I have yet to drop the phone but it seems to be very well made to me, either way I would suggest getting a Krusell cover for it which I did but has not been delivered yet, and also insurance for $4.99 a month from Cingular which covers anything and everything for life of the phone, thus that problem is solved.Someone mentioned something about the 'address book being slow' not even sure what that means, I only have about 8 numbers in it so far but it comes up virtually instantly for me, maybe if you have 100++ numbers in it might take a couple seconds? dunno.As for searching through the phone book, they mentioned you have to make a new entry for each number for same person, NO you dont, you have the option to show numbers any way you wish, either by 'Name' or 'Speed dial #' or 'Voice name' or even by 'Email' and with or without a picture of the person.Want it faster and easier if you have a lot of names/entries? then set it for 'list only' 'no picture' and by 'primary number only', simple. You can also separate numbers even further by putting in 'Categories' such as 'Business/Personal/General/VIPs'Bring up Category your number is in only that way even if you have 100s of Names & #s it thins them to category.When you have 'primary number only' listed all you need to do then to get all the other numbers & Email listing for that Name is to 'Highlight name and use left or right on the Navigation button to get all the other numbers' once again very simple and easy to use. I find the Phone book to be excellent & fast.1-2 have mentioned something about 'ear piece volume too low' I\'m in total agreement with 'Harry G from TN' the ear piece volume is fine just make sure the 'volume' is turned up and it is just a good as any other cell phone I have ever used, but like Harry mentioned make sure your ear is right at the 'top edge of the phone', too low and volume will sound low.Now myself I find the phone overall to be excellent, gets a great signal, has way more than enough features for me, works very well for its intended purpose 'PHONE' seems to be very well made, nice size, looks great, has a really nice screen with sharp image & colors.I have only ONE complaint so far......The screen which looks outstanding inside under any indoor lighting, especially if you are in the dark, well that same screen outdoors under 'sunlight' is virtually unreadable. So there you have my one gripe.I will come back and update this if anything changes, but as for right now and for FREE and can hardly see how you can go wrong with this phone.(Update 4/30/06.)Well 7 months later and these phones are still working flawless with ZERO problems of anykind.I charge it maybe twice a week so battery life is still great.Neither my wife or I have this alleged sound problem some seem to have the earpiece and speakerphone volume are plenty loud.My wife is constantly playing solitaire on hers, so she has worked the hell out of that keypad the last 7 months and no problems.These phones are the best we have ever had by far, so like I said before take these 'bad reviews' with a grain of salt.Some may indeed have a faulty unit which is going to happen regardless which phone you buy, but I bet a large percentage of these problems are simply operator error.These phones are excellent and I would recommend them to anyone.Still the only slight fault that I can gripe about on them is the screen is hard to see in bright sunlight.and it took an extra couple weeks to get rebate but was no problem, just a single phone call and problem was solved.(Update June 23th 2006)Have had these phones over 9 months so far without a single problem, they work flawless.As I said above anyone giving this phone a bad rating either has that rare bad one of the bunch or simply doesn\'t know how to use the phone. I have dropped this phone 3X so far, last time was 4 days ago in the parking lot on concrete and no problems at all, not even a scratch. (Of course the Krussel case is outstanding and helps a lot)We used both our phones while on a Cruise to the Caribbean and as long as we were in an area/Island that had cell service we had good reception and no problems at all, and as long as we were in a US territory (Puerto Rico, St. Thomas, St. Croix, St. John) the calls were not roaming.You get the phones for FREE, Amazon is good to order from with no problems, Cingular so far for us anyway have been very good and the service (in our area) is far better than what Alltel was.There may be some phones out there as good, some im sure will have a better camera, however I seriously doubt you will find a better all around cell phone & service.'], ['Works!!'], ['I love this thing!

I bought this one for my Motorola Razr.  The fit is perfect, all cut-ous line up with the phone ports, speakers, etc.  This phone actually fits the Razr slightly better than the Body Glove I use for my Motorola V551.It provides some protection from drops, the elements, etc. both externally and internally, whereas many cases, including the popular hard cases for Razrs protect only the exterior.A few people have written reviews that the phone doesn\'t close a swell as it does without the case.  It closes fine.  You add a slight thickness to the edge of the phone with a case on it, so basically it closes all the way, almost exactly the same as without a case, but because of the case, you won\'t hear the phone cover 'click shut' but it is closed and its not like the front is suddenly lose or pops open.

No worrying about bringing it into the house to charge, forgetting to take it back out, or losing the charging cord.  I love it because it's so convenient and can leave it in the car 100% of the time, so it's always for sure there.'], ['The Motorola H300 is the ultimate handsfree headset for those that want a headset that they will be able to use forever.  Why do I say this?  Because, this does not have a non-removable rechargeable battery like most handsfree headsets.  Instead, it can be operated with a single AAA battery.  I just got it, so I cannot verify the performance of the battery, but knowing that I won't have to throw this away in a couple of years is worth it.  The features include call accept, call deny, mute, hold, voice dialing, 3 way calling, and you can turn off the blinking blue light (if yo're so inclined).  Even though it takes a AAA battery, it's about the same size as a comparable rechargeable headset.  It may be 2 mm thicker, but the same length as most.  It works great and is a no nonsense kind of headset.  If you want a basic headset that does about the same as those expensive ones, and you want the security of just changing a battery, this is the headset for you.  If I have any problems with the duration of the battery or with its operation, I will update this review accordingly (check the date of review to gauge how long since purchase... if no update, then no problem).'], ['I keep one at my desk, one in my bag, one in my car.Battery life is fantastic -- standby and talk. If I\'m afraid of it turning on, I can pop the battery compartment with my thumb.

They didn\'t...so I got two more of these H300\'s.Turns the AAA battery route (I use rechargeable Eneloops) works out GREAT for me... after all these years, it\'s never been a bother... I don\'t even notice it. There\'s nothing to plug into the wall, no extra charger, I\'ve always got a spare AAA charged up in the house, bag, car for 'emergencies.'I love this thing... back at Amazon today to order one for my mom to try to convince her to use one of these things. She liked the idea of the AAA battery so maybe having to plug her other ones into the wall slowed her down too much.If you get this from one of the Amazon sellers you can get one new for half/third cost as of todays date (3-29-2011).I\'m sure the technology on bluetooth headsets has improved by now but that\'s what they said about a few other high-end POS I received from friends who tried to get 'the best' for 3x the price.

I've had it now for 3 days and it is great.  I use a 700w, so despite the other review, this works great with my 700w no issue whatsoever.  Yes it helps it to be on the same side as the phone, I carry my phone in a holster on my side, when I moved it to my left side as I was talking considerable static showed.Volume is great (I was struggling with volume on my wired hands free headsets, but this has no problem with volume.)Configuration, took about 2 minutes, 1 minute reading the manual and another minute doing it.  The manual is about 2 pages, pretty quick and easy, just follow their steps and you are golden.Distance, any further from my hip and it would get more statis, about 2-4 ft it is good, beyond that, forget it.

It paired with my Samsung D807 in a couple of seconds.  The ear piece goes in the ear, so outside noises are less distracting.

I got this unit at a close out price, and I feel that I definitely got my money's worth. I have never owned a Blue-tooth head set before so I have nothing to compare it to. I read reviews on the Internet and decided that this was the unit I wanted in my price range. The sound is clear and intelligible on both ends,... as far as I can tell, even in the car, which is what I bought it for...(to use while driving)... and it is fairly comfortable for about 2 hours of ware, but after that becomes somewhat uncomfortable. I think with some adjustment it may be possible to make it feel even more comfortable, a lot of comfort depends on your own sensitivity,  ear and head shape. Once paired with my phone, Razr V3, it reconnects each time in a matter of seconds (usually). Only once did it take longer. Before buying this headset I had never hear of Plantronics before, but I would say that their products have a good build quality and good sound. I liked these units more than the  Motorola headsets mostly because of the way they fit rather than any sound quality issue.'], ['I recently bought a new cell phone (Sony Ericsson Z520a) with Bluetooth. I spent a few days researching the various headsets out there, and soon discovered that only a handful appeared to be worth buying -- and all were between $100 and $150, which I did not want to spend. I came across these by accident, and couldn't find any of the negative comments common with headsets in this price range. Granted they're only Bluetooth v1.2, but they're light, have a built-in rechargable battery, are quite comfortable to wear, and have very good sound quality. In addition, the pairing process is quite simple.If your priorities are quality sound, comfort, built-in battery, and reasonable price, these will be hard to beat. I like it so much I bought a second one for my wife.'], ['this item came within time its great I got it for my mom she is currently is still using it and I order it over a year ago.'], ['I purchased this headset to use with my cell phone.  As it turns out I use it with my computer and love them.  They  are easy to use, long battery lfe and sound great.  They may be a bit uncomfortable or odd because of the back of the head design but all headphones have some kind of pressure due to the design.  The only time I notice their presure is when I wear them for a few hours.  Short term no problems.  By the way, I wear glasses so that may be the culprit.I'd buy them again.'], ['Before I have this product, I have ordinary earphones for my Moto680 cellphone which has stero radio, also I have other moto blue tooth earphone, but this one is good, long time power supply but it is more heavier than the single ear bluetooth.Volumn control is good, loud enough. single ear BT is out of control some times, you may hear nothing when you walking on the busy street or windy days. This one give you all availability.drawback: 1. when phone call comes in, you will wait for longer time than single ear BT. 2. the size is big, can not put in your regualr pocket. 3. the pad easily drops, you may lose one of the two very soon. I used glue.Anyway, it is good one, you can talk to 2 hours meeting several times with one time full recharging.I love it.'], ['Durable.  Sounds great.  Mic provides good sound for those on the other endof the connection.  I like the wrap-around fit (walkman-style headphones look dorky - wrap around is better).  Although.. after 30 minutes the tips of my ears can become sore which I am learning to cope with.  I use it with Motorola L2 cell phone and Anycom 250 USB dongle for Skype.  This is the one to get.  I had a competing Plantronics product -- in fact two of them -- but they both broke in the same place due to the use of plastic in high-stress areas.  The Motorola design is much smarter.'], ['I got this headset last week Wednesday and have been using it ever since.  I read a lot of reviews and found as much information as I could about this before even ordering it.  And after reading very mixed reviews, I just had to find out for myself.So here it is:I use it with my Motorola Q, which is also not a bad phone, and it works perfectly fine with it.  It paired up without any problems and stays connected when you want it to stay connected.  I have not had the opportunity to really test out the battery life yet, but I have tested it for approx 2 hours in between charges and it holds up fine for 2 hours.Incoming sound quality is perfect.  Actually a little too loud, but you can just lower the volume.Outgoing sound is also much better according my girlfriend who has heard me on my previous Sony HBH-660, and she says that the sound quality is much better.  Even when I have my windows rolled down going 65, she says she can hear me fine, although she says it sounds like I have the faucet running.  So I do question how the DSP itself works since it doesn't really filter out the windnoise.The system itself is pretty sleek and gives you multiple charging options.  So there should be no worry of running out of battery unless you talk consistently for more than 3 hours at a time.One gripe I do have is the button and the plastic.  The button should be easier to press and should require as much pressure as it does.  The plastic seems kind of cheap, which is probably what makes the thing so light, you barely even notice you have it on. So they should have use better plastic with better chrome paint that doesn't scratch or chip off.Overall, I give it 2 thumbs up and the best headset I have used so far.'], ['At airports watching people talking into space with some huge clam attached to their ear with a flashing blue light swore me off bluetooth. This headset from Plantronics is extremely small, nicely packaged, it paired immediately with my Blackberry 7100t.The packaging is very cleverly done and the headset itself is a simple silver cylinder and weights a mere 9 grams. Audio quality was high and a recent 7100t software upgrade increased volume levels to more than acceptable. A variety of included ear pieces ensure yo're likely to find a comfortable fit. I've been getting about 2-3 hours of talk time on a single charge which while not perfect is adequate for most people.As a small minus, the button to connect/disconnect/turn-on or off takes a bit of getting used to as it feels a bit mushy missing a positive click to confirm your selection.If yo're worried about compatibility, the Plantronics website provides a pull down selector for mfg/phone to confirm.'], ['I purchased this headset from Amazon for about $80 and have had it for over a month.  I pair it with my RAZR and Uniden\'s cordless ELBT595.  I\'ve been highly pleased with it\'s performance.BLUETOOTH PAIRINGThis was extremely easy and handled through the one master button at the top.  Hold it down until it flashes red and it will pair with your phone.  Answer calls by pushing the button, and hang up by pushing the button.  Simple as that.  I\'ve gotten consistent call quality within a range of 10 feet from the phone, and haven\'t experienced any interference from WiFi networks.VOLUMEI think the biggest problem with bluetooth headsets is that they are not loud enough.  I tried several different bluetooth headsets that my friends have, most noteably the Motorola HS850 and H700.  Those work well but I still have a hard time hearing people when I\'m driving in a car, or there is a low level of ambient noise in the background.  The greatest feature of the Plantronics 640 is that it fits in your ear, and is therefore probably twice as loud as any other headset I\'ve tried.  I can hear while I\'m driving in the car, and usually don\'t even have to put it on it\'s loudest setting.  You can also mute the headset by pushing the up and down volume buttons simultaneously.COMFORT/FITI was skeptical about the fit of this headset.  I never liked earbud headphones (think iPod) as they fail to stay in my ears whenever I have to move around.  That\'s why I was astonished that the Plantronics 640 stays in my ear without any problems.  And it is very comfortable as I\'ve worn it for periods over 1 hour and have not had any irritation.  Since it fits in your ear, and not over it, you can easily wear sunglasses with it (great for driving).  If I know I\'m going to be highly active while wearing the headset, I will put the optional over-the-ear clip on it, but for most instances it is not necessary.DESIGNThe 640 is small and light, and stylish enough for me.  The headset comes with a bevy of attachments and a carrying case.  The headset fits into a 'pen-clip' holder that serves two purposes.  First, you can carry your 640 in your shirt pocket if you wish (and look extremely nerdy I might add).  But the pen clip adapter is the common link to charge the headset.  Put the headset into the pen clip and you can now charge it with the included AC adapter, or you can add one of the extra attachments to the pen clip so that you can use your phone\'s charger to also charge the 640.  Almost all phone types are supported.  There is also a AAA battery adapter that can link up to the pen clip and be used to charge your 640.  The battery life of the headset itself is great; I\'ve talked on it for about 5 hours and the headset still didn\'t die.PROBLEMSThere are few and they\'re nit-picky ones.  It\'s unfortunate that the adapter to use the RAZR\'s mini-USB phone charger to charge the 640 is not included.  You can buy one off eBay for under $20, though.  The pen clip adapter is ok, but not the absolute best way to carry your 640 around.  It fits in any pocket, and protects the mic, but does not cover the earbud side of the headset.  Therefore, I usually carry the 640 in the small case it comes with.  But this case holds ALL the attachments and it would be nice if there was something smaller to transport the headset alone that protected the entire headset and was smaller than the full case.  Some people have also complained that the mic picks up lots of ambient noise.  I find this to be the case of all headsets, bluetooth or corded.  If you\'re in a crowd, people are not going to be able to hear you on your cell phone or bluetooth headset--they are going to hear the crowd.  I believe there is a new 645 model that has some noise-cancellation features, but that is done with digital software processing, not filters physically sitting on the mic.OVERALLI don\'t think the perfect bluetooth headset has been produced yet.  But I\'m giving this one 5 stars because as of June 2006 this one is reliable and is undoubtably the loudest headset out there.  My hearing is just fine, but if the volume on your headset or cell phone is the biggest sticking point with you, then this is probably the best headset you can get.  If you can get this headset for $80 or less, I highly recommend it.'], ['I'm very impressed with this headset. The set up was simple on my SE K700i phone. I just paired the two devices and added it on in handsfree mode. This headset is light and extremely comfortable in my ear. Just move the gel earpiece to the left if you use it in your right ear for additional comfort. Conversely, move the gel earpiece to the right if you use it in your left ear. It fits so well in my ear that I don't have any need to use the ear loop.The sound clarity is great. Everyone I talk to says they hear me very well. I just needed to raise the volume up a little to hear everyone perfectly. I don't hear any static whatsoever when I use this headset in my wifi and bluetooth networks at home.Plantronics gives you a lot of charging options. I use the SE charging adapter, which I snapped on at the bottom of the little pocket case, so I could use one charger for two gadgets. This headset comes with a Nokia, Samsung, Siemens and Sony Ericcson adapter for charging. The headset also comes with its own charger, in case you don't own one of these 4 phone models, which you can use in any wall outlet. I tried that method of charging and it works fine too.This headset also comes with a mobile charger case, where you use a AAA battery. I didn't try that method of charging since I have a SE car charger which works well with the included SE adapter.Voice dialing works fine. That's important to me since I'm a mobile professional who spends a lot of time traveling in my car.The headset does beep right before you make a call. It also beeps right before it signals for the name you want to call. I don't find that irritating, as one other reviewer mentioned. That's just how the headset operates. And let me emphasize that this headset works great.It is the best bluetooth headset I've ever owned.'], ['fits like a glove, good design, just got it today and im impressed. i really like how it seperates the volume up and down buttons as well as the power button. also makes them easier to push. i wouldnt trust it to save the screen from a 3 foot drop but for ordinary use i think it will serve me well.. also the material has a good feel to it. and its not to slippery.'], ['it is a nice rubber case that fits snugly around my nexus.I like it and it will protect it from small drops and bumps. I would by no means expect it to protect it from a full fledged fall or smash against concrete. good for me I don't plan on throwing it or dropping it from any heights I just seem to have little slips and this is good for that. I am happy with the product'], ['I honestly love this case. At first I was sort of skeptical about its back design, now I get it though, it obviously needs the two textures to add grip and the other one to make it smooth enough to fit into your pockets with no additional friction to it.'], ['With TPU cases it's usually a hit or miss.  With this one, my Nexus 7 is a happy tablet.  The back area has a flat, slick, X area while most of the sides retain a textured area that works very well when holding in your hand.  I often surf the web or watch videos while in bed and have had no problems with the case being slippy.  For the money this is a great case and probably the best you will get under $10.'], ['This is large enough to hold my I pod touch in an otter box case and my mytouch with out a problem, so my guess is it can hold just about any portable device or cell phone on the market. The grips work well and I have only had it fall off once, but then I licked it and put it back on and haven't had any problems sense. I don't use the vent holder but it looks like it might work if I played with it for a while.'], ['I've had another bluetooth headset for more than two years. I've never been happy with its performance-it was small and light, but at freeway speeds I just could not hear the other party.I purchased this headset four days ago. I could not be happier. This morning I sat it on my head for a long commute, and forgot it was there within 5 minutes. The road was wet, but even with the accentuated tire noise I could hear every word. I made several calls, and one person was not aware I was in my car.I have a slight audio discrimination problem, which makes it hard for me to hear over noise. This headset has a leatherette ear cushion that fits over the ear, blocking most noise. It can also be turned quite loud, uncomfortably so. This is great, because you are never wanting for volume.It comes with both wall charger and car charger, so I'll never have to carry this one in to the house to charge it.Look at the photos before buying: notice that this is a big headset. That's part of what makes it work so well, but if you want the compromises inherent in the tiny designs, don't buy this.UPDATE: After another week, I'm still totally excited about this product. a couple of days ago I ran a conference call from my cell phone, from the car. One of the other parties was on a lousy speaker phone. I could hear them perfectly.UPDATE AFTER ONE YEAR (January 2009): Just keeps working. Still pleased as punch. Battery still lasts forever.'], ['This is the best headset for truckers. The back ground noise can not be heard from caller. The ear pices is just the right volume. the Mice takes some use to it. When you talk, you talk in a normal voice. and don't have to speak up to be heard. If you put the mice at your mouth, it will distort the sound. The best place just below your lower lip. The paring has to be done every time to turn the headset on. Will not automatic paring at turn on. Good thing its easy do to.The charge time is great and really holds the charge in stand-by and talk time. the only thing I don't like its heavy and sometimes the mice gets caught on the shoulder strap, when looking side to side.'], ['I drive a truck and found out how hard is finding a good bluetooth headset. Many I have tried worked fine, but the biggest problem was that other party could not hear me (because of engine noise). When I accidentally found this one I gave it a try. And it is awesome.

Call quality in my opinion is even better when I use this headset.PROS:- perfect voice quality- battery lasts long- noise cancelling microphone makes others to hear you- solidCONS:- bulky- expensive (but worth this money)'], ['I,M A TRUCK DRIVER AND THIS HEADSET IS PERFECT FOR USE IN TRUCKS, MY FRIENDS TURNED ME ON TO THIS MODEL.

THE BLUE PARROT HAS A NICE QUIET SOUND TO IT, EVERYONE SAYS I SOUND GOOD ALSO WITH THE THE CUP EARPIECE I HAVE TO TURN THE VOLUME DOWN OR IT BLOWS ME OUT SO YOU HEAR VERY WELL WITH IT.

They are a bargain.  I suppose that they are not as good as $100 earphones, but for this price, I don't expect them to be.

There are included in the package 3 different size rubber tips to fit different ear sizes.'], ['they work great.  came with my phone.  kind of an odd set up with different lengths of wire and the ear things are not foam, they're rubber.  so that's odd, but they sound good.'], ['I bought this phone for the sole purpose of making calls and because of the bluetooth feature. I have handsfree bluetooth link in my car, and it has been a great help in allowing me to focus on driving and not holding a phone. I had a Motorola Razr V3 that was given to me when I signed up for my plan, like most products built now days the stupid thing died just out of warranty period, and don't ever expect a helping hand from Motorola, and much less T mobile they both could care less. When I received this phone I installed the SIM card and started to use it, I have had it for a few weeks now and the reception is better than the Motorola, plus I was able to install a few games and apps. on this phone that make it just what I was looking for and then some. The best part of this is that I did'nt have to lock in under another contract with T-mobile and when the contract is up so will my business to them. I think its a great phone for the money, packed with features, and especially the bluetooth integrates really well with the handsfree in my car.'], ['Amanda Richards hit the nail on the head, but she didn't get into how nice the Bluetooth is on this phone.  In addition to being a VERY SOLID (both in build and function) phone with a lot of features you wouldn't expect to find in something this low in price, yo'll also get FULL Bluetooth 1.2 capability.What does this mean?Well, you can transfer mp3 ringtones to it, you can connect a headset to it, you can transfer themes and photos to and from it and you can even tether it to your laptop to use as a modem!If you want a fancy phone, yo'll have to pay for it.

I've used on all kinds of roads (and switched to 3 different cars), always works great.2- Easily adjustable.  Quickly adjusts to whatever angle, whether flexing the arm or turning sideways/straight up.  The ability of the tabs on the side to fold in are the best design of the 3 I've had.  The others maintained a fixed holder on the bottom, which affected how it held when I turned it sideways.3- Wow, I love the grip design.  It allows each arm to slide left/right.  So, I can keep the bottom ones tighter to avoid pressure on my volume buttons while sliding one of the top ones to avoid pressure on my action button.I haven't found a con yet.Good luck!'], ['I received my swivel mount and spent a few minutes playing with it.  It holds my Droid X pretty securely with the adjustable sides that also have adjustable sliding arms that go up and down, so I do not have to have any of my buttons blocked.  The swivel section is very bendable, but it is stiff and will hold its shape well.  The side arms have a foam coating so they really grip my phone well once they are pushed in.  Releasing the phone is very easy too, you just push the button on the bottom and the side arms release the pressure and slide out allowing for easy retrieval of your phone or GPS unit.This unit is made to mount to the windshield or some other smooth surface.  I am in New Jersey and its illegal here to have anything attached to your windshield.  I do not have any smooth surfaces to attach the suction cup to my dash, so a little ingenuity was called for during my installation.  I took a flat piece of sheet metal, cut it about 4 inches square, sanded it, painted it, then did some light sanding with a very fine grit paper over the paint to make the surface absolutely smooth.  I then attached my custom built metal plate to my dash with some strips of double-stick tape.  Then I attached the suction cup to the plate and it holds very well.This is a very good mount and appears to be made very well.  I expect a long life with this product.Ps: my friend has the same mount that clips on his air conditioning vent.  He loves it and told me about it, that is how I came to find this one.  I did not want to block the vent, so I got the one with the suction cup and long arm.'], ['Bracketron just plain makes good products. Works great.What else can I say. Here are a few more words to meet the minimum word requirement.'], ['Update 2/17/14 The unit is still working however it has gotten more difficult to get the unit to suction to the window.

Purchased the exact same unit.Update 2/24/13 Still love the mount. Works flawlessly.I have only had the mount for a few days but it is better than anticipated. I drive for a living and have used the mount in 6 different vehicles. Works perfect in all. Easy and flexible to use in any vehicle. Have yet to have the suction demount. This should fit the Galaxy Note 2 without a problem.I've been using it for a couple weeks and still working great. If you live in a cold climate you may have issues with the suction.

It works seamlessly with any phone system and has a multitude of connection options. The range allows us to go to the end of our warehouse to look at stock while talking with the customer. Not to mention that if I'm not at my desk and the phone rings, I don't have to rush back. I can use both my hands to look up quotes, and stock while I'm on the phone without craning my neck.

Here are my observations:+ Good Range; the unit covers all of our fairly large shop+ Easy to Setup; just follow the simple instructions and go+ Easy to Use; simple as picking up the phone and turning on the headset (we addedPlantronics HL10 Handset Lifterto make it even easier)+ Great Sound Quality; we never had any static issues, even in our heavily wireless environment- Heavy; not absurdly so, but takes some getting used toThis headset gets used just about everyday that our shop is open and it has never given us any problems.

MP3s can also be used as ringtones. all-in-all, no complaints here! well, except the 256MB limit.radio: nice little feature! you HAVE to have the headset plugged in to listen to the radio, as it acts as the antenna, but while it\'s plugged in, you can send the sound to come out of the speakers. radio is easy to use, channels are easy to store and radio sounds good. the radio (as well as the MP3 player), will pause if you get a call and resume when you\'re done. you can also use the radio and MP3 player while doing other things on the phone. headphones sound awesome.games: the phone came with six games: asphalt3D, blockbreaker, bruwnswick billiards, jewel quest, name that tune, tetris, and 3D extreme air snowboarding. all games are locked, so you can only play them for about a minute and then you are prompted to purchase them. they are $6-$8, roughly. total rip off. thanks cingular.ringtones: again, thanks to cingular, there are only six ringtones that come with this phone, and they are pretty crappy. there are free ones all over the place, so don\'t go spending your inheritance on buying them from cingular. or, do as i do and grab them off another SE phone via bluetooth. there is a little app including on the phone called musicDJ and you can actually make your own ringtones. kinda cool. i\'ve made a few so far and they aren\'t bad. well, ok, my mom said they sounded horrible, but what does she know?syncing: this phone syncs with your contacts, tasks, notes and calendar, if you have those kinds of programs on your PC. i got my phone to sync with my outlook, which now means i\'ll sell my PDA. SE\'s PC suite works pretty well and transferring files is easy. however, it seems like every now and again, when i am connected via USB, it reboots my phone. don\'t know what that\'s about. i don\'t think any harm is being done.the phone feels pretty solid in your hand, weight-wise. i\'ve never owned a slider/swivel phone in my life, and while it\'s not the most convenient to 'flip' open, it\'s not bad. you can actually place and receive calls with the phone swivelled shut, too, which i liked.it seems like SE didn\'t leave anything out with this phone (except a memory slot) and i love it. they thought of everything on this phone: radio, little flash light, dedicated key lock button, infrared, calendar, music/video/picture DJ,stopwatch, timer, tasks, notes and the list goes on and on. the phone\'s styling (ie: orange cover) isn\'t for everyone, but i love it. my phone did come with a 2nd cover, in navy blue. it\'s styling and shape is great and i love the orange backlit keypad. it\'s definitely a head-turner.and, above all, reception and clarity of calls is great. i\'ve had no complaints when i\'ve used the phone, the headset, the bluetooth headset and speakerphone. it\'s really nice. this of course, can be dependent on your network. i live in the midwest in a fairly large area (260K people), so we have cell towers all over the place.pros:* nice size.* bluetooth, infrared and speakerphone.* radio and MP3s* clarity of calls is excellent. reception is great.* screen is nice and bright.* easy to get pics, vids, etc. on and off the phone.* phone comes with everything you need (except car charger)* this phone is loaded - nothing is left out!* sony ericsson\'s interface is great; apps like the address book are loaded with room for tons of info. menus are easy to use.cons:* no memory slot. on-board memory, while not bad, is limited to 256MB.* price (well, at full retail anyway).* camera is disappointing for a 1.3MP.* phone goes into standby (screen off) after 15 seconds. very annoying and to date, i\'ve found no way to change that.* games are locked for only 1 minute of play. thanks cingular ;( not ONE free game is included.* keypad buttons are small, and close together. i have small hands, so the key size is not so bad, it\'s the fact that they are right next to each other.this is a great phone. its big disappointment is the fixed 256MB memory, but for a lot of people who just want to listen to a few songs and not 500, this phone will suit you just fine. i am hoping to keep this phone for more than six months (which is about how often i get a new cell phone) - it has everything i need and nothing i don\'t. kudos to sony ericsson for putting out a great phone! woo! ;)'], ['I did a lot of research on phones before finally settling on the W600i phone. I really didn\'t need an MP3 player as I usually carry a PDA with me as well, but the features on this phone were just too good to pass up. I considered a Motorola RAZR but saw a lot of complaints about battery life. Well, no problems here! I\'ve previously been using a SE T616 which had superb battery life, and this phone is equally as good. Which is certainly important if you do plan to use it as a music player.First things first...entering phone numbers. So tedious on most phones, and something I always dread. Thankfully, the W600i came with software to sync with Outlook. It took me a little while to figure out the syncing software. When you hook the phone up to USB, it can go into phone mode or file mode and for some reason the software always tells me it can\'t find the phone if it is in file mode. So to sync, I had to put it in phone mode. Turns out file mode was used only for transferring MP3s. Still tells me it can\'t find the phone, yet the transfer did work! Sometimes when I plug it in, my computer won\'t see it without rebooting, which cost me a lot of time and aggravation trying to figure out as well. So somewhat annoying implementation here, but such a time saver, and something I\'ve never had before at all with a phone, so it\'s hard to gripe. I usually don\'t bother to put appointments and tasks on my cell phone, but since they just sync with Outlook, now that\'s easy to do as well. This may not be a SmartPhone, but it could replace a PDA for casual users.The MP3 player is decent enough. Sound quality was much better than I expected. Then I tried the built-in FM radio. Wow, awesome reception here! The cord acts as an antennae so you have to be sure to unwind it for best results, but considering how far from the stations I am, I was quite impressed with how nice it sounded. Some simple equalizer settings, nothing special. Only gripe would be the lack of an external memory card, there\'s certainly room for one so it should have been added. I guess Sony\'s proprietary Memory Stick would be large to squeeze in, so rather than add a SD slot, they just left it out completely. Booo to that.Phone data features worked great. I got even better reception on the W600i than my T616 and now also have Edge. Had no problems using Bluetooth to connect up to my PDA and laptop, and speeds were pretty nice. The Media Net services worked fast and there were some nice demo services included as well. Not sure I will pay for these but definitely worth considering.Camera is better than most cell phone cameras I have used, but still nothing great. The pseudo-flash is at least an attempt to improve indoor shots but any real camera still beats the pants off it. You can even use the little flash-light as an SOS beacon if you get lost. ;-) Even better is the image import included with the PC software. Was nice to easily copy over GOOD photos to use for my contacts.To use the keypad, you have to swivel the back of the camera down. It makes a cool little sound and lights up, but it\'s not the easiest motion to do one-handed and will also make getting a decent playthrough case a lot harder than other phones. The buttons are easy to press though, an improvement over my old T616. There are also a couple buttons at the top of the screen that confused me as to their function (of course, I don\'t bother with manuals!) I did figure out that they were used when playing games in landscape mode. Neat idea. There were a couple bugs in the OS as well. When using voice dial, an misrecognized command results in a really weird and annoying sound coming from the phone. And the voice command symbols in the address book are very buggy...appearing and disappearing from the contacts that don\'t have them. Hopefully a phone firmware upgrade will fix these.This is the first cell phone I\'ve had with a real speakerphone. You really can use it without having to hold it up to your ear...assuming you are someplace it won\'t disturb other users. You can play music through the speaker as well, and use those MP3s as alarms and phone sounds, so lots of things to play with here. For some reason a lot of the phone tones you can buy through Cingular are not available for this phone yet, but hopefully they will get those working soon. I also had trouble downloading a couple games I purchased.Some users have reported issues with using bluetooth headsets, particularly with voice control. I\'m not a fan of having another device I have to charge all the time, so I prefer using a regular handfree. And this phone actually comes with one for free! The headphones double as a handsfree headset in addition to the FM antennae, so it\'s well worth carrying and using over a bluetooth headset, IMO.I was able to get both my PDA and my laptop to pair up with it and use it as a modem for internet connection, although my laptop was a bit flaky and did require a bluetooth upgrade and reboot to get it working. Great speed difference with the Edge network! According to Windows, I was getting 400Kbps, with my old phone it was usually around 100Kbps. The phone has a nice 'E' symbol that tells you when you are on Edge, and 'G' for regular GPRS. Even in my house out here in the country I am able to get Edge, which was a pleasant surprise. I haven\'t traveled much yet, but it looks like they already have pretty good coverage, and metro areas in particular shouldn\'t be an issue.So, this may not be the smallest, lightest phone out there. There are definitely some issues like the weird swivel design, voice dial bugs and lack of memory card support that may be cause for complaint. But if your priorities are a phone with great battery life, excellent reception, Edge and bluetooth, and easy to use, this one should definitely be at the top of your list. If you don\'t already have  a portable MP3/FM player, I don\'t see how you could even consider anything else! I\'ve yet to find the perfect phone, but this one comes so close to it and is so much better than the other phones I\'ve had, I have to give it 5 stars.'], ['I've had a Blackberry since the first one came out and I *love* the new 8700 series.  It's sleeker, faster, and as functional as ever.  I recommend the T-Mobile version however because the rate plans are much better at about half what Cingular charges.'], ['If you want good phone capabilities and email, then this is the phone for you.  I have had many smart phones which had a camera, MP3 player, ability to do excel, etc and found these phones to be slow and inferior to the Blackberry.  While it takes a little while getting used to it, once you do, it is a much faster device than any other phone for emailing and texting.'], ['The Blackberry 8700 is wonderful! It does a great job of retrieving email from all five of my accounts, and functions well as a phone and PDA. I am thrilled.Until two weeks ago, I was carrying around a top of the line Dell Axim X30 with 624 MHZ and wireless capability, and a cell phone. I teach at several universities and do consulting work so I have five different email accounts and I'm constantly checking my email at least twice an hour. Prior to getting this Blackberry, I had to find a wireless spot to use my Axim, stay tied to my laptop, or pay out the nose for web access on my cell phone. It was terrible.Now with the Blackberry, all of my email accounts are programmed in so I'm instantly notified when I get a message. Because I can respond within seconds, I never miss a beat. My students and clients often comment that I respond quickly to their needs, which they love. The 8700 from Cingular has GSM and dual band service so I can be almost anywhere in the world and still receive my email messages instantly. I was in Hong Kong last week and the Blackberry functioned flawlessly. I could use it as a phone in HK and also receive and reply to email.Additionally, I love the fact that I can synch my MS Outlook calendar, contacts, address book, tasks, etc. to the Blackberry. (It also has the ability to synch with other PIM programs.) I have mine set to sound an alarm 15 mins before I'm due in a meeting or appt and it has been a life saver. When you are always on the go, it's easy to forget stuff. This Blackberry makes it easy to keep everything in one place. Oh, and surfing the web is a breeze. The display is a nice size and it's crisp and clear and shows almost all websites easily.Lastly, I love the size of the 8700. I thought it would be a bit bulky but it's not. This version is about the same size as the 7290 Blackberry and fits nicely in your hand.My only two complaints are that some of the buttons and functions are not immediately intuitive, and RIM has yet to come out with an assortment of cases for this version. But, after about 15 mins of playing around, I was able to figure out just about everything (the manual that RIM provides covers only the basics), and I found a great case on eBay.I only wish I had discovered Blackberry sooner!'], ['I often hear debates over who has the better smartphone --- Palm or BlackBerry??I have two lines with Sprint PCS, with my personal line having a Treo 700p and my business line connected to a BlackBerry 8703First off - I love both phones! However, they are very different, particularly in their strengths and weaknesses --- my review is based upon how well each smartphone handles the following things -- PHONE FUNCTIONS- EMAIL- INTERNET- PHOTOGRAPHS- MULTIMEDIA (Music & Movies)- SPEAKERPHONE- BLUETOOTH- COMPUTER SYNCHRONIZATION- MISC - (Text Messaging, System Stability, PDA Functions)Okay..... here we go -1. PHONE FUNCTIONSFor me, the Treo 700p has much better phone functions --- this is mostly because of their touch screen capabilitiesWhen I wanna dial a number off of the Treo, I immediately start spelling the person's name on the keyboard, and I immediately go to my phone book, where I can touch the number I want to dialThe BlackBerry is a bit more complicated, as I cannot touch the screen --- therefore, I'm limited to dialing based upon scrolling to the right name and then pressing the numberOverall, the BlackBerry isn't bad ---- however, I know a lot of people like to use their phone while driving their car (with a bluetooth headset on) or like to use the phone in situations that require a quick reaction.... if you wanna use your phone in the car, then the Treo is the best choice, mainly because the touch screen allows one to go to any name and dial immediately --- as funny as this sounds, you can really only use a BlackBerry, for phone calls, in situations when you can give it total devotionWith that said.... if you are not dialing numbers while driving in the car, then the BlackBerry's phone functions are fine.... they take a bit longer to get going, due to scrolling.... but they get the job done just fine (and yes, you can use the keyboard to look up names in the address book, as well)2. EMAILOkay - this is really the only category where the BlackBerry really beats up the Treo 700 and beats it up GOOD!!!First off, email on the Treo 700p is no totally useless.... the Treo comes with VersaMail, a program that handles all POP, IMAP, and other email accounts with ease..... there's also a program available called CHATTER EMAIL for the Treo, which makes the Treo's email functions even faster and more versatileHowever, the big problem with Treo email is that one has to download the email --- in other words, you have to log onto ChatterMail or VersaMail and wait for a few mins as the program downloads all of the email yo've received --- now you can configure a program like ChatterMail to be constantly downloading your email, so one receives it immediately, however this is a BAD choice because such a function basically keeps the Treo on a 'constant' phone call, as it downloads email --- in turn, your cell phone mins get eaten up, battery life goes down quickly, and phone calls are missed do to your phone being occupied on the 'other line'THe BlackBerry, on the other hand, downloads all of your emails immediately, without draining the battery, without interrupting phone calls, and without eating up your cell phone mins --- my BlackBerry can download my emails more immediately than my own laptopIn addition, the BlackBerry 8703 keyboard is absolutely awesome --- so I much more prefer to write emails over my BlackBerry than I do over my Treo 700pIn summary on this one, the BlackBerry is clearly much better with email.... and if email is the most important thing to you, then go BlackBerry for sure! --- however, the Treo 700p holds its own with email, provided that you are willing to wait and download your emails over something like Chatter or Versamail3. INTERNETBoth phones handle internet similarly, however, I would give the edge to the Treo 700p mostly because of the TOUCHSCREEN, as it allows one to navigate webpages with more freedomThat said, the BlackBerry is fien too, just a bit more limitedBoth phones can connect your laptop to the internet, depending on your cell service --- I've been very pleased with the Treo's ability to connect my laptop to the internet, provided that I use its USB cable with the program USB MODEM ----- I don't have as much experience doing this with my BlackBerry, but I have heard that the results are favorable when doing soEVDO speeds on both phones are very good4. PHOTOGRAPHSIf pictures are important, then the Treo 700p is the CLEAR winnerThe Treo 700p comes with a great multimedia program, fueld by an embedded Kinoma player, which can allow you to show off pictures with pretty good easeI'm a Mac user, so I use MarkSpace to get my pics onto my Treo and I'm very pleased with the Treo's ability to show off pictures --- the resolution and quality are shown off very wellI have yet to get pictures onto my BlackBerry though --- I have seen other friends of mine show off pictures on their BlackBerry, but the program does not seem as sophisticated or as user friendly as Palm'sClearly, the Treo 700p is made to handle pics, whereas the BlackBerry is lagging in this area5. MULTIMEDIA (Movies/Music)I am actually DEEPLY impressed with how well the Treo 700p can handle multimedia, both music and moviesI am a filmmaker myself --- with the use of the program, KINOMA PRODUCER, I have compressed many of my short films to small files, for the purposes of showing them off of my Treo to some friends --- the Treo 700p plays the files excellently, with sound coming out of the speakerphone and the resolutions of the films looking excellent!Even better is that the Treo 700p can handle MP4's and MPEG4's, allowing me to encode the best resolution and best sounding files onto my Treo ---- sadly, the Treo 700p cannot play songs downloaded from the iTunes Music Store, as those are copyright protected, but it will play anything that one encodes with my own devicesThe music/mp3 player on the Treo is also excellent, playing tunes through the speakerphone, or through the headphones that the Treo comes withAs far as I can tell, the BlackBerry 8703 does not have any multimedia functions, so good luck getting an MP4 or MPEG4 onto this thing ---- however, Blackberry is working on this, so future BlackBerry's will have this capability --- but if playing movies and music is important to you, then the Treo 700p is the only choice in this departmentLastly - important to include that the Treo 700p also has a built in camera and a built in camcorder --- and the camcorder movies taken on the Treo are actually pretty good quality! --- the BlackBerry 8703 has no camera and no camcorder6. SPEAKERPHONEThe Speakerphone on both phones is excellent and easy to use, with both being loud and clearIf speakerphone is your main buying point, then you couldn't go wrong with either phone7. BLUETOOTHBluetooth is very solid on both phonesI've been especially pleased with the Treo 700p, whose BlueTooth capabilities are much more solid and stable than the old Treo 650pThe BlackBerry seems to have few problems connecting with my bluetooth headset and other devices ---- I would say that both phones boast great bluetooth capabilities8. COMPUTER SYNCHROIt's important to note that I have a MAC and I sync all my phones off of my MacFor the Treo 700p, I use MarkSpace's Missing Sync, as Palm's software is terribleFor the BlackBerry, BB has launched free Mac-Syncing software, that can be found on their websiteSyncing any smartphone off of a Mac is never an easy thing and I've not been too happy with the processWith that said, I'm pleased with MarkSpace's Missing Sync as, for the most part, the program does a good job of syncing my Treo's contacts and calendars, as well as doing photos and music --- unfortunately, the syncing process seems to take forever (usually at least 35 mins) but syncing once a week isn't a big dealI was pleased with how well the BlackBerry synced to my Mac, however, none of the email addresses for my contacts have transferred --- so there are some kinks to work out, and it could be that I'm just not syncing it rightMain point - both phones sync fine with the Mac, but expect some minor probs --- however, for what its worth, I'm pretty satisified overall9. MISC - (Text Messaging, System Stability, PDA Functions)It is important to note that the BlackBerry is MUCH MORE stable than the Treo 700p --- I have had my BlackBerry shut down on me once in the last few months, whereas the Treo 700p probably shuts down once a weekSo if stability is important, than the BlackBerry is the way to goThe calendar and address book functions of both phones are excellent, but I would say that the Treo 700p's PDA functions are a 'bit' betterBoth phones are fine with text messaging, as well--- CONCLUSION ---If I could only use ONE of these phones, then I would definitely pick the Treo 700p --- the reasons why are because the multimedia functions very much impress me, as I like to store some pics and movies on thereIn addition, the phone functions are easier to navigate and the touchscreen is something that I couldn't live without on a daily basis --- text messaging, bluetooth, and PDA functions are all excellent, as well, with email being the only thing that lags (but even that's not so bad)However, I love the BlackBerry's solid system and its excellent email performanceHaving one as my personal cellphone and the other as my business setup is the perfect balance --- however, I would give the slight edge to the Treo 700pWith that said --- if you want multimedia and other phone functions, in addition to better phone functions, then the Treo 700p is your phoneIf you are all business and clearly value EMAIL over multimedia, then the BlackBerry may be your best betHope that helpsPEACE AND LOVE & HAPPY BUYING!!!!Muhammad Ali Hasan'], ['This is my first blackberry.  How I got along without it all this time I have no idea.  Earpiece quality sounds great, speaker phone sounds great, microphone sounds great.  The overall layout is quite genius.  I love all the programmable features and the bluetooth accessories are a must.  Web browsing with EDGE technology is surprisingly fast.  If you text message often as I do, the keyboard and the 'auto-text' features are amazing.  I literally send text messages 10 times faster than I used to.  If you live by email as I do, (90% of my clients orders are placed through email), receiving them instantly is so important.  No more running back to the office or home to check for orders.  I highly recommend this product.'], ['I've been using some form of Blackberry ever since the early days of the 950/957. This latest version is a great step up in terms of usability but really no huge functional differences from earlier models.Recently I swapped my Blackberry 7100i for the 8700C.If you spend a lot of time using your Blackberry device, then you definitely want to upgrade to the 8700C:PROS-Better screen (on par with the 7100)-Version 4.1 O/S-Can load MP3 ringtones-Better call notification settings-Faster web browsing (though not lightning fast)CONS-The data speeds are not lightning fast-Requires a Blackberry Data Plan (lots of new buyers don't realize that you must have a BB specific plan in addition to your regular phone plan)-Batter life is just ok-Some quirkiness in the 4.1 O/S-ExpensiveOverall the bright screen and the slightly faster web browsing make this a really nice upgrade for anyone who is a serious BB user. Currently only one carrier is offering this phone, however search around and you can find services that will allow you to enter a number to open it up to other GSM based carriers (which is what I did) and make full use of their network and your existing plan/sim card.'], ['I have bought at least half a dozen cases for my s3.  I think I have finally found my favorite, and one that may make me stop looking for something better.  I feel my phone is protected in this case, and all the buttons work properly with it on.

I would recommend this case to a friend.'], ['was looking for a simple, classic, BLACK case. theres lots of flat/matte black cases out there but i liked this one because it has a lil black gloss trim and that helps the phone slide in and out of my pocket easily. great case for the price. perfect fit too.'], ['Ear Pieces for Voyager worked great. Helped with the fit for my ear and they were very comfortable. They are good quality and lasted right up to the point the voyager quit working.

It fit perfectly, and works as advertised.  If yo're looking to replace the tips on your voyager, this is it!'], ['Great factory replacement parts for Plantronics PLT 510.  Ear cushions with O rings fit tight with no problems.  The new foam cushion feels great on the ear.  My old earpiece had a black covering that was coming off in my ear.  The windscreen is great too for the microphone.  Makes your bluetooth like new again.'], ['I stupidly left myPlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset [Retail Packaging] in my car too long before realizing how the sun and heat were going to expedite the disintegration process of the foam covering of the earpiece.  I don't use my Bluetooth earpiece often, so when I did go to use it, the soft foam just crumbled in my hand.  I was irritated with myself because I had no idea where to get a replacement foam covering.I should have remembered all the times Amazon has come to the rescue!  When I found this foam replacement set, I was delighted because buying it would address another, nagging problem I've had -- the Plantronics headset picks up any slight breeze and makes it intolerable for the person on the other end of the phone conversation.  So, buying this set let me replace the eartip PLUS add a windscreen to the speaker boom, too.Putting on the eartip cover was tough because it's a TIGHT fit, and you wonder if yo're going to tear the eartip in the process (I didn't).  Putting on the windscreen on the speaker boom was not as difficult, but it also was a tight fit.  I did have the speaker boom windscreen fall off once when I was transporting the headset around in my pocket.What's really nice is that still have left-over pieces to this set that I can do another repair job in the future (as long as I remember where I stowed these pieces!).Highly recommended!'], ['I picked this up on Amazon for under $20 after months of thinking about buying one. My needs are small; I\'m not on the phone all that much, but in the car a lot. I\'m also not overly picky. If it works...I\'m happy.The Motorola is small; about 2.5' long and yet it seems to pick up my voice quite well and the sound quality on my calls thus far has been good. Better than on my Nokia phone! The earpiece is adjustable, and fits my ear very well.The packaging on this item was kind of weird. Plastic baggie with the charger, bluetooth headset and directions. I guess I expected a box?The unit charged fully in about 2 hours. My Nokia phone picked it up just fine once I enabled the bluetooth to find it.All things considered, for the price I paid and what it does. I\'m happy with the purchase. The true test will be the item\'s durability and battery life, which only time will tell.'], ['I gave this headset to my wife and she uses it all the time.  Works great and is comfortable.'], ['First of all I just want to say, this low cost Bluetooth headset is a great value.  There are a lot of Bluetooth heasets to choose from on the market today.  Many are more stylish and have more bells and whistles, but for under $30.00 this headset is one of the best values out there.  This pink version is very cute and offers a perfect color match for the Versizon V3 series Motorola Pink Razr.  However, I believe the gentle pink color is the only stylish element of this headset.  Take away the pink and you are left with a very generic looking earpiece.Now lets talk about performance.  The H500 couldn\'t be eaiser to use.  It paired with my daughter\'s Verizon Motorola Pink Razr in just seconds, and the button configuration of this unit makes perfect sense.  The buttons have gentle action yet offer a satisfying 'click' feel when pushing them; not mushy feeling at all.  The sound quality of the speaker is quite good but not acceptional.  The voice quality of the microphone is very impressive.  When I am on the phone with my daughter, she actually sounds much better with this headset than when using the Razr phone alone.  It does tend to pickup a great deal of background noise though, so it may not be the best in noisey environments.  The H500 sits in a very stable manner on my daughters ear.  The ear hook is soft and flexible and can be worn for extended periods without discomfort.  It does not look or feel as if it will fall off your ear even when tipping your head.I am giving this headset a full 5 stars.  I do not rate the H500 so highly for its outstanding style, but rather for its simple functionality, solid performance, great build quality and overall value for the money.  You just can\'t get a better Bluetooth headset for under $30.00!  I highly recommend this headset for any woman that is looking for a cute color match to her Verizon Moto Razr, while also seeking a comfortable fit and impressive performance.  There may be better looking headsets out there, but you\'ll likely suffer penalties in cost and/or performance.'], ['Light weight and simple to use. My charger was bad but AGFA Store sent me a new one very fast.'], ['This is one of the best purchases I've made on-line. The H700 is a big upgrade for me (previously used the H500). No complaints whatsoever. Love the fact I can turn off the headset by just closing it. I have a small face & small ears -- this dainty piece is perfect!'], ['Compact, stylish, and very comfortable.  Currently one of the only headsets known to work well with the HTC Mogul.  I wear it all day and never run out of my charge, and sometimes even forget that I am wearing it because it is so lighweight and comfortable.  Amazon has top pricing on this product too.  I could buy two here for what I'd pay full retail elsewhere.  Sound is clear on both my end and the receiver's end.  Great product and great value.'], ['I've spent the last two weeks ordering and returning bluetooth headsets.  Finally, after going through quite a few models (Motorola H350, Motorola H500, the Plantronics 655, the NX6000), I found a GREAT one.  I was willing to pay up to $150 for a headset that was comfortable, easy to use, and -- most importantly -- that my callers didn't complain about.  This headset has great sound quality on both ends, and the setup and buttons are very easy to use.  The boom folds out, and the headset turns on.  You fold it back, and the headset turns off.  Several of the headsets I tried had TERRIBLE buttons -- small and hard to work without looking in a mirror.  These are great.I was really looking forward to writing this review tonight as I'm hoping I can help someone else avoid all the research I did (CNET, endless googling) only to find this one through trial and error.Look no further, yo've found a great headset!  BUY IT NOW!(and no, I don't work for Motorola!! haha)'], ['This H700 replaces an HS810, it is smaller, lighter and seems to work just as well with similar battery life. It cost less too !'], ['...I have it paired with my RAZR V3 phone. Sound quality is excellent, both receiving and sending. It is loud enough that I can hear in my rather noisy car without a problem. No one I've talked to has complained about the sending sound quality at all--most didn't know I was using a headset. Pairing was simple and worked according to the instructions.The headset fits me well, doesn't have any problem with my glasses, isn't particularly noticable when I'm wearing it. The buttons are logical and work well.The charger is the same as the RAZR charger (same voltage/current and connector), so now I have two chargers that can be used with either device...and can charge the headset using the car charger I got with the RAZR. This is very handy! I think that the charger compatability should seal the deal for RAZR users--in my opinion, this is definitely the Bluetooth headset to get if you have a RAZR.The only negative is that the manual, like the manual for my RAZR phone, is imcomplete. For instance, although the container says that you can pair with up to eight devices, I could not figure out how to pair with additional devices, nor how to switch between devices. I wish Motorola would invest in the writing and production of proper manuals--or at least to make the full manual accessible on the web, if they don't want to clutter the manual for most people with features most folks won't use.Oh...and I'd also like to be able to wear the thing without having to put it in Standby mode...but given how little energy Standby mode uses, that's not a really big deal. Perhaps if Motorola made the microphone boom switch always switch the headset off, but not switch it on unless you press the big button, at least as an option.'], ['I had a H500 but when it stoped working I went to get the H700 and I like it much better.

Little pieces everywhere.The H700 - Finally a good quality headset!  Callers have no problems hearing me...  I have no problem hearing them while on the road.  I have a quiet car, but always found myself pressing a headset into my ear in order to hear conversations.  Not the case with the H700.  This thing has volume galore!  In fact, I had to bump it down a few ticks, works great at highway speeds.  It's comfortable... (unbelievably light) you think the 850 is small....  the 700 is truly 30% smaller as Moto claims.  When closed, this thing can hide behind a .50 cent piece.  Buttons are easy to operate by feel.  Anyone who uses a headset regularly knows that adjusting opposing buttons can be challenging - Not with the H700.  There is a place top or bottom to rest a finger if you need to adjust up or down easily.  Pairing and setup took 1 minute.  Sound for me is crystal clear.  This thing has all the bells and whistles.  Works as promised right out of the box. 4 stars for design and operation.  One plug home or car fits all, 5 stars for a top notch product.'], ['I purchased this bluetooth headset for two main reasons. First, it uses the same charger as both my Motorola Razr and RIM Blackberry 8700C. Secondly the device easily turns on and off each time you extend the microphone.I've used about 1/2 dozen other bluetooth headsets and this is one of my favorites.Here are my summarized pros and cons:PROS:-Uses the same charger as other Motorola RAZR phones-Open/Close microphone to turn headset on/off-Small, lightweight and easy to put on (one handed eve)CONS:-Only connects to one BT device at a time. I have both a RAZR and Blackberry that I carry with me everywhere. With these two devices I cannot have the H700 connect simultaneously (other Bluetooth products - notably the Plantronics) are able to connect simultaneously to two devices.I recommend this headset, and Amazon has the most competitive pricing available. Easily beating even the discount superstores where I'd seen this for 50% more.'], ['IMHO this is slightly better than the Moto HS850.  It's smaller, and lighter.  The boom is smaller.  But if that's not an issue, then both are equal IMHO.Now for the problem where people cannot hear you, or you sound muffled or away from the phone.  Wearing your bluetooth, look in the mirror and see how the boom touches your cheek or if you have a beard it'll touch that.  Note there is a very small hole on the inside of the boom that gets the sound.  Now anything that touches that will impede your voice....it's like putting a towel over a regular phone and talking to someone. Not you do not need puffy cheeks for this problem to happen.  Unless you have a very narrow face, chances are this will happen to you and yo'll blame it on the bluetooth!TO fix this, get either Neoprene tubing or that sticky foam on one end (mole skin) and cut a small piece and put on the hinge near the boom then a smaller piece (if needed) on top of the other.  This will make a space between your cheek and the boom so people can hear you!  You will still be able to close the boom.'], ['I recently dropped my land line and went 100% wireless for telephone service; with this change, I wanted to make sure I didn't suffer from numb arm talking on the smaller cell phone for longer periods and wanted to use a hands-free approach. My previous experiences with that were not very satisfying back in the day of earbuds and dangling wires. But, with a new cellphone came Bluetooth wireless capability, which opened up a new world of options.I had played with a number in the store, but didn't get any real world experience with them. But, I really liked the design and feel of the H700. I did some research - much of it through reviews here on Amazon; this left me a bit skeptical as there were many unfavorable reviews written here - they mentioned negatives like poor sound quality, minimum range, and Bluetooth connective problems to name a few. But, I decided to side with some other review I had read and the positive reviews on Amazon.The bottom line is I am very happy with my H700. I have experienced absolutely no problems - the people I have talked to all can hear me fine, and I can hear them; I have had the H700 up to 7 feet from my phone with no reception problems; and the H700 was easy to setup with my phone (LG VX8300) and immediately connects whenever I turn the device on.Feature-wise, the H700 is great! The buttons are easy to use and understand and the flip mic is great idea...the phone rings, just flip it open (keep it closed to conserve power) and the call is answered immediately; flip it closed to end the call and it powers down as well.

Most headsets will only pair to one device, so if you want to switch between devices, you have to re-pair it every time.  In my case, I have the headset paired to both my Motorola Q and my Playstation 3.

SOUND QUALITY OUTBOUND --- I called my own voicemail and talked into it, while wearing this headset --- not only did it sound great in my regular voice, but I could even hear myself whispering (yes, I tested that too) --- so don't believe those who say that people on the other end will not hear you --- outbound sound quality wise, its the best headset out there, as I heard no static, no drop-outs, and no tunnel effects2. SIZE --- easily, this is the most comfy headset out there --- it is optional to attach it to your ear, and wear it without the loop --- honestly, the loop holds it in place much better, with no discomfort one bit --- yes, you can wear it without the loop, and it will hold okay, but either way is fine --- the thing is TINY which is neat3. CALL PICK UP --- call pick up happens instaneous, with a half a second delay --- no manual initiation necessary4. BATTERY and CHARGER --- the battery seems to hold just fine all day --- and the charger is real small --- the package also includes a USB charger, so that you can charge it over USB on your computer, which I thought was pretty useful for people on the roadOther pros would be that the RANGE seems pretty solid, and PAIRING was easy (I liked that JABRA created a SEPERATE pairing button)I would consider VOLUME a pro --- it would be nice if it was louder --- however, I can hear everyone just fine, provided that I'm indoors (whether that be in the office, in the car, etc) --- it can hold its own outdoors, but if you use your headset a lot outside, then you may wanna test run the JX10 first --- I think the Cardo Scala 500 had the LOUDEST volume, and the JX10 comes very close to that loudnessCONS ---1. BUTTONS --- this is really a MINOR complaint --- I think the button placement (accepting calls, ending calls) could be a little better - but its not a big deal, and certainly, not a deal breaker --- the thing is so small, that its kinda hard to fit any buttons on it anywayshonestly --- can't think of any other consThe headset is definitely the best looking --- silver with black streaks!I love this headset, and its gonna be awhile until its unseatedyes, the price is steep, but its worth it --- take my word for itthank you for reading and HAPPY BUYING!!!!!'], ['Works great for my home office.

I looked at corded headsets, cordless, and a variety of brands, but this unit kept coming up with high praises.The clarity is great, and it has a variety of volume (macro and micro) for both the mic and earpiece.  It works seamlessly with any phone system and has a multitude of connection options.  The range allows us to go to the end of our warehouse to look at stock while talking with the customer.  Not to mention that if I'm not at my desk and the phone rings, I don't have to rush back.  I can use both my hands to look up quotes, and stock while I'm on the phone without craning my neck.  Their are earpieces and over the head options.  Not to mention the battery life lasts all day as long as you plug it in at night.Great product!'], ['I have this headset for work and use the band that wraps around the head instead of just the ear loop.  I find this is the most comfortable option for me.  The headset has been great and I have never had a problem with it since i have owned it (approx 2 years).  The range is great and I can get up from my desk and walk to the printer during a call no problem.  Overall I am very pleased with this headset and others in my office have purchased this based on my recommendation and they love it as well.'], ['Cliffnotes summation-  AWESOME well thought out easy to install product.......!!!Details-Purchased the CS55/HL10 after an Amazon price match locally. Been using the standard Plantronics corded headset for years on my old ATT 4 line business phone. I finally got tired of the corded limitations and researched this unit online.Basically the system installs nicely and the 'handset lifter' is included($39 value)at the Amazon price. My older phone supports a headset but is not configured for the newer headset connection option which this Plantronics unit also supports. The lifter is simple to install and powered from the Plantronics headset recharger base. Handset and speakerphone capabilities are not affected by installation of the lifter device under the handset. You can use your phone handset if your earpiece is still charging or be really lazy and just use the speakerphone if your situation allows that.With the lifter installed you simply put the headset on your ear, push a button on the earpiece and the lifter raises the phone hand set about 1/2 inch out of the cradle and your line becomes active. Then dial your number or hit the your speed dialer on whatever phone you are hooking the system to. What really clinches the deal on this system is that you can use your older desk telephone without having to spend additional funds on a landline phone set.Wireless frequencies-The new wireless frequency standard is extremely clear and static free with my office Netgear N900 and DLink N-Wireless routers up and running without any equipment or frequency conflicts that plague the older systems that may have caused major problems in the past. During my test calls and walking around testing in the house the voice quality and signal was crystal clear at all times.Good installation instruction manual and online help if you need it make this a real snap to install. Let the headset charge in the base for 3 hours and you will be up and running for 10 hours of talk time if you need it..............Plantronics CS55/HL10 Wireless Headset BundlePlantronics is not the cheapest but it is one of the best and it JUST WORKS!!!!!'], ['Update:  After several motnhs of use, this unit is working great.  Range is easily 50 ft+  I like to pace while I talk on tough calls, and this unit is flawless for that!  ;)---The Plantronics CS55 is a nice desk-based bluetooth unit.  I use it on an Inter-Tel phone system at work.  The body of the unit connects to your telephone line, an AC adapter, and a unit that sits on your phone to lift up the receiver during calls.  So there are a lot of wires, but you can tuck it away at the edge of your desk.  The ear piece, which charges on the main unit body, is pretty hefty and I generally have a hard time getting to hang on my ear securely. But it is flexible and after a few moments of adjustment, it stays pretty well but still wobbles around a bit.  Earpiece quality is very good.  For speaking into the unit, you will need to recrd yourself at different mouthpiece placements (e.g., talk call in to your own voice mail).  The mic picks up lots of noise (rustling of clothes, breathing, drinking, etc.), so it is good t be aware of how these are being heard by doing some testing.  Good voice quality, but watch those extra noises that yo might not be used to thinking about on a normal phone handset.  Good unit, works fine.'], ['My old Plantronics headset needed to be replaced and I went with this one.  It is much more sturdy, with the headset resting very comfortably in the charging unit.  My old one would 'float' once in a while and not charge when I thought it was, which meant I couldn't use it the next day until it charged for a while.  Not so with this unit.I had a behind the head band I use which for me is very comfortable and I can quickly take the headset off and it rests on my shoulders.  Sound quality is excellent.  I have not had any complaints on the other end either.Highly recommend this product for anyone needing versatility and walking around from the base unit.  I can easily get files from across the room or do other things while talking without missing a beat.'], ['I have tried 3 or 4 different bluetooth headsets for my office phone but finally decided to stay with the Plantronics one because it is the most comfortable one and the sound quality is definitely the best.  The handset lifter works great so you won't have to push buttons and lift handsets and ....It just makes things a lot easier.  Great product!'], ['not a lot of these batteries around my area, the 1 i did locate wasn't nearly as cheap,  this works great.  not sure what else to say about a good battery.'], ['the product was what I was looking for, a little delay on delivery but no complain, a lot more cheaper than getting it at any retail, so the wait is so worth the wait. can not complain, but I will recommend it'], ['I charged this battery and used  it on my sell phone one time and it is very good battery, but know I am keeping it as a spare, till the other one stops working.'], ['This battery is great! It was shipped immediately and even arrived with almost a full charge. I did finish charging it before use and it has lasted almost a week, although I don't use my phone a lot. It looks and works exactly like the original and is well worth the price.'], ['The ability to leave my MP3 music (cell phone) in my gym bag and get a serious workout without disruption is worth the price along. Being on call, it's also important that I don't miss any of those important phone calls. Getting interrupted with a voice announcement of who's calling makes it all worthwhile. After the first use I was hooked. All of my weekday workouts are with my bluetooth stereo headset. As for the weekends, I'm back to the Zune, not because I dislike the headphones, because I need to escape from the phone.'], ['I'm using this product past 5 months and its b'ful and awesome sound quality. I didn't found any issue with this product. Easy to configure and connect. It works with my Sony Erricson W580i Walkman phone as well as my laptop. Sound quality and beats are very good. Distortion only if u move your head 90% on left, but ignorable. Its not bulky and fit easily. Its in build mic is good. While playing a music if call comes u can atend it with this headset. It has its own volume adjustment. Overall, a good peace which makes me fully satisfied. I got what i was looking for. no wire hassle now.'], ['I have owned this item for at least five years, I don't believe that I've never reviewed it.  This was one of the first bluetooth headphones to come out and I still believe it is one of the best.  I have only a couple of things that I would consider to be cons. 1.  The headphones are really heavy on your ears.  It becomes painful after a while.  2.  The buttons are really sensitive.  I have accidentally called and hung up on so many people that it's ridiculous.  On the other hand, I love the ability to listen to my MP3 player and use my phone with the same headset.  I have been told by many people that the sound is incredible compared to their bluetooth headphones.  The bass is wonderful and people can hear me clearly when I make a call.  It picks up background noise which is not good, however.  I tried other headphones and I keep coming back to these.  They are, by far, the best pair that I have owned.'], ['After reading some of the other reviews that were not so favorable, I was pleasantly surprised with this headset after taking advantage of a really good deal recently.  The sound quality is excellent with really impressive bass response.  Now I am pairing this with an LG VX8700 and perhaps that makes some difference.  There are some minor issues though.  Placing the phones properly on your head can mean that they are comfortable for a time, but eventually after about 2 hours they do seem to pinch. But even then it is not unbearable.  I have cycled with them, music stops when you answer and then resumes.  I have jogged with them, ear pieces pop off so you can rinse if necessary. Occasionally either the phone or the headset gets confused if you are trying to do something too fast.  Flipping through songs, and you have to re-pair the device.  Sound quality is pretty good through the microphone considering the distance.  Very slightly muffled, but still clear enough to not be a limiting factor.  A cool feature is that tap the right ear piece and it opens the music player on the phone and starts playing.  Jabra should consider putting a locking button at an appropriate location because it is easy to inadvertently push one of the many buttons when you are taking off or adjusting the phones.  Eventually you do learn how to handle to avoid this, but it is quirky.  I would so recommend this headset for those looking for something to pair with one of the newer phones that support a2d over bluetooth.  Excellent for cycling!Update 8/22/07  This headset continues to operate great, despite being dropped numerous times. As a side note, I found as I was riding today that the pairing between my lg vx 8700 was fouled as the music was intermittent.  While there is the occasional stumble in the otherwise smooth streaming, this was different.  I ended up removing the device from my 8700 and re-pairing it.  Fixed.  The only thing I can think of is that I had recently unplugged my phone while it was docked in usb mode to my pc and you are not supposed to do that without ending via the menu first.I use this headset to run with too and found a little floss can go along way.  Yep, I tied a bit of floss between the ear pieces leaving one side with a simple knot.  Then with the floss in position across the top of my head I pulled the ear pieces down until the plastic pieces which normally end up pinching the tops of the ears were just above the tops.  I then double knotted the simple knot again and voila, the floss helps support the headset while you are running and the pinching that I noted in my original review is reduced greatly.  I am actually sitting typing this listening to some Petty. Great stuff...'], ['Jabra did nothing wrong with these. They are solidly build and beautifully designed. They have paired easily with every device I\'ve tried, and even work very well as a hands free headset for a bluetooth cell phone. However, they don\'t work with my Mac, and contrary to the insinuation by the other reviewer, this is in no way Jabra\'s fault. Bluetooth is bluetooth, and it\'s up to the computer manufacturer to support the 'profiles' supported by various devices. In the case of the Mac, Apple\'s Bluetooth support is incomplete; they don\'t handle the advanced audio profile required for stereo headsets, and so this headset (or ANY other stereo bluetooth headset, for that matter) will not work with a Mac until Apple decides to fix this. This is completely out of Jabra\'s control, and this is a very well engineered device. If you own a Window\'s XP computer, this will work very well.The only negative I can find is that the headset is not adjustable and thus may not fit everybody comfortably. (My wife, for example, can\'t get these to sit well.)'], ['I purchased these with minimal expectations and am quite impressed. I have been using these with my cell phone and the sound quality is superb. Also, using these for phone calls is quite convenient. The microphone is great and sound quality is top-notch. Even when music is playing and you get a call it automatically pauses the music for the phone call and then resumes it when the call is finished. Battery life is way longer than I had expected; I have owned these for a couple of months now and have only had to charge them twice. Buttons on the headset are quite convenient as well.  I would say the only downside to these is that they are a tad bulky somewhat resembling earmuffs. Also, depending on your head size these may or may not fit on you; I can fortunately say that they fit me with no discomfort and stay on my head even when at the gym. Great product!'], ['You can read the other reviews about how awesome this phone is.  But, if you want a bluetooth headset to go along with it, get the Plantronics Voyager 510. I\'ve tried the Motorola HS850 and H500 & a Logitech BT headset and all of them had significant static.  I\'ve searched google and found other people have the same problem with this phone and multiple other types of headsets.  Go with the Plantronics Voyager 510.  It has very very little static and I can leave the phone in one room and walk to another with only a slight (almost negligable) increase in static.  The only problem is that the 'answer' button on headset will answer the phone but I won\'t automatically connect to the headset.  I must first answer the phone by pushing the green button on the phone and then press the 'answer' button on the headset. . .afterwards, connection is seamless.  A minor inconvenience for the luxury of wireless BT that is virtually static-free.  Don\'t take my word for it. Buy a Voyager 510 from a local store where you can easily return it if you\'re not happy.MP3 RINGTONES!!!!this phone is great for making MP3 ringtones.  HOWEVER, you most change the file extension from '.mp3' to '.3gp'. Transfering '.3gp' files to your phone is a sinch with the free USB cable and PC software.  And, if you want to edit your mp3 so that you play only the chorus of the song as the ringtone, Samsung gives you software for that too!!!! It\'s all included in the PC Studio Software that comes with the phone.  DON\'T FORGET TO CHANGE THE EXTENSION TO '.3GP' .  The phone will allow you to play any mp3 songs (like an IPOD) but it won\'t allow you to make MP3 songs as ringtones unless you pay for it by downloading from some website like T-mobile. . . OR, by the method mentioned above.  Changing the extension to 3gp is also easy if you have a program that will show you the FULL NAME of a music file (i.e. check_up_on_it.mp3), like Nero Burning ROM.'], ['Motorola was floundering in the cell phone market until they came out with the RAZR.  Worldwide, it made a fashion and technological statement, which catapulted the manufacturer from a dismal afterthought to a leader in the cell phone market.  Then they released a candy bar equivalent (SLVR), and then improved on the RAZR\'s lines with the stylish clamshell PEBL.  This review is for the Motorola PEBL.After using the PEBL for a few days, the first thing that impressed me was the sound quality.  Recently, I have played with Sony/Ericson, PalmOne, Nokia and Samsung phones, and must say the Motorola sounds best.  First of all, the volume in the earpiece is loud enough for me to hear while walking on a busy New York city street, with cars, trucks and buses all creating a deafening noise.  Second, the volume control button is well placed to allow you to easily adjust the level.  Third, and best of all, the phone is intelligent enough to filter out much of the loud background noise, so that the person you\'re speaking with can hear you without struggling to make out what you\'re saying.  I have found that Nokia is good at this too, while Palm, Samsung and Sony/Ericson phones don\'t do this well at all, with Sony ironically at the back of the pack.  Also noteworthy is the speakerphone.  While it\'s not as loud as an office phone\'s speaker, it is plenty loud, for example,  to participate in a conference call while driving.  And with the background noise reduction virtues of this phone, I was impressed.  Also, it has voice recognition - based solely on the spelling of your contacts, the phone will recognize what you\'re saying and be able to voice-dial.It may seem odd to make such a fuss over sound quality in an age of smart phones, but as a designer recently explained to me: form should follow function.  So let the PEBL first and foremost be a good phone.  Then you can add the bells and whistles later.  Attention to this principle is what earned the PEBL five stars from me.A note about carriers: GSM is worldwide, so you can use your phone overseas as well as in the USA.  However, this limits you in the states to Tmobile and Cingular.  Having used both, I feel that Tmobile sounds better, but Cingular has better coverage.  It\'s a tradeoff.  Both carriers offer a 7 or 14 day 'trial' period during which you can test the network\'s performance.  I recommend use that trial, and don\'t hesitate to bounce back and forth while keeping your number.I have four major pros for the PEBL:1. Motorola is pioneering the cell phone market by making all of their latest models 'quad-band' GSM, which means the phone will work well in the USA (850/1900 Mhz) as well as the rest of the world (900/1800 Mhz).  Most GSM phones are Tri-Band (850/1800/1900) so while they\'ll work great here, but performance abroad will be touch and go, with the phone performing poorly indoors.  None of the others (Nokia, Ericson,  Samsung etc.) offer quad-band GSM as a standard, and until Motorola\'s recent offerings, you could only find Quad-Band phones in massive PDA smart phones.2. Battery life: All cell phones give estimates in standby time and talk time. But the realistic factor is how long will this thing last between charges for the average person?  My answer: 3 to 4 days.  With moderate use (about 10 calls a day, totaling between 30 and 45 minutes), I needed to charge the phone after the 3rd day.3. USB port: the phone\'s connection to the world is via a standard mini-USB port.  The charger fits this, or you can plug it into your computer with a standard USB to mini-USB cable.  This is the same cable that connects most digital cameras or certain mp3 players (at least the ones that don\'t use overpriced proprietary cables).  Chances are you already have one of these cables and if you plug it into your PC, two things will happen: the phone will start to charge from the USB, and the PC will detect a new device.  Download the drivers from Motorola (if you didn\'t get the CD with your phone).  In addition to phone drivers, there is a 'Phone Tools' application that lets you to synchronize your contact list and calendar with Outlook, or you can simply backup the phone\'s contents.  You can synchronize your photos, ringtones and SMS messages as well.  Here\'s the best part: the phone is also a modem.  Make sure you have a data plan before connecting to the internet, and you no longer need a hot spot.  GPRS will give you a little more than 2x the speed of dialup, EDGE will take it up to about 4x.4. The phone has an alarm built in.  In fact it has several, and you can name them, and if you turn the phone off at night, the alarm will still work, and ask you if you want to turn the phone on when you silence it.Other noteworthy items: the screen is good, the camera produces reasonable images and videos, and there is enough memory to snap over 100 shots at the phone\'s highest resolution.  That is a nice touch.And now, three Cons:1. For the longest time, I have not cared much for the Motorola contact management interface.  Nearly all phones now allow you to have multiple numbers / addresses per contact, but Motorola hasn\'t caught on yet.  If you have a contact with multiple phone numbers, that contact will exist multiple times.  This makes dialing slower with Motorola phones because you\'ll have to scroll through a longer contact list; searching for numbers is not nearly as intuitive as with Nokia or other phone brands.2. The phone allows you to assign custom ring tones for certain members of the address book; however, for contacts with a custom ringtone, the phone doesn\'t differentiate between calls and text messages, so if a contact with a custom tone sends a text, the phone might play an entire minute-long song rather than a quick beep beep, which can be annoying in the middle of the night.  Just avoid using custom contact/ring tone assignments and you\'ll avoid that problem.3. The shiny dialing surface and screen will pick up grease from your face and require regular cleaning if you want to avoid your phone looking 'icky'.In conclusion, I was happily surprised with the PEBL.  It is a very sexy phone, and it sounds great.  It is the perfect phone for the audiophile, or for a person who wants a device that just works without having to cope with all the secondary bells and whistles phones have these days.  Historically, Motorola was known for producing good hardware - a virtue that is clearly stated with the PEBL.  If you intend to use all the fancy features of modern cell phones (SMS, MMS, etc) - in other words if you plan to use the software features, expect them to be less intuitive than with other brands of phones.  As much as Motorola is known for producing excellent hardware, their menus and navigation can be bewildering at times.  I think they should get the folks who designed the hardware to redesign the software interface.  Then, the Moto range would dominate.  In the end, it\'s a good phone, it\'s solid, it\'s small and light enough to fit in comfortablty your pocket, and above all it works.'], ['I have had this phone for two months now and it is the best one I have owned,I have had three razr's and many other so called cutting edge phones even the V3i and none are as good as this,as for the pebl it is simple to open unless you are a butter fingered fool,and as for the finish wearing off on the keypad well mine is just fine.The phone is made better than the flimsey Razr is,you want a quality phone that works as well as it looks get this phone,you want cheap made buy something else.'], ['I purchased this phone to use in Europe during a recent trip.

Price was a major factor here compared to retail and I wanted to wait a few months before considering a new phone.

After I remembered the little pocket inside the case, I put 4 business cards inside. These were just enough to keep my Treo from moving. Actually the pocket can't really hold more than 4 or 5 business cards without making it difficult to close the Treo in the case. I really like the magnetic flap. It's easy to open and close. Finally the belt clip holds securely on my belt.'], ['Very happy with this headset - thank you!I don't have any problems or complaints.

Chances are you will have forgotten to turn the unit off and your caller will be live wherever you left your Bluetooth headset within 30 feet.  The H700 folds when you take it off your ear and when it folds, it turns off.  Sounds good reasonably priced and effective, Its that simple !!'], ['It's lite, comfortable, sound is good and no one that I've talked to has commented that my phone sounds different. I did however have a problem getting it to pair. I had to go online to figure it out since the directions that came with it were poor. I could not get the light to stop blinking blue and it has to be purple to pair. The online directions said to close the mic, hold down the button until it turns purple and then open the mic. That's not really correct either. You have to open the mic while your finger is holding the button down. They forgot to mention that important step. I can't tell you how many times I had to do it before figuring that one out. That said it works well and pairing was easy after getting the light to turn purple. Obviously with the 5 stars I gave it I'm recommending it.UPDATE: February 11, 2009 The Bluetooth has slowly died. People were no longer able to hear me. They said it sounded like I was miles away. I took very good car of the unit, always kept it in a case and was worn maybe two hours a day on average. I tried cleaning the mic but it didn't help. It lasted a year and a half so I guess I got my moneys worth. Just thought yo'd like to know.'], ['I've paired mine with a Razr V3 black and a Razr V3i without any issues.

The company that wrote the app for me is long gone, but the MDA still works. The MDA's full-sized pull-out keyboard was amazing quality for the time, in an era when on-screen Blackberry keyboards were the standard.The only reason I'm not using this phone anymore is because I can't get a decent T-Mobile phone signal where I currently live and work. The phone still works excellent as a data and texting device. I had to switch to Verizon and an iPhone in order to get a decent cell phone signal.If you can find one cheap enough, it's an interesting little device to use with Wi-Fi.

Had seen reviews that averaged 4.4 out of 5, so it seemed to be a decent choice. This turned out to be one of the best decisions made this year, as the BlackBerry turned out to be far better than expected... it was faster than my previous phone, reliable, versatile and rugged, and there were few dropped calls. But the phone had one simple problem: it\'s a battery eater!Went to my cell phone provider to see about getting an extra battery, and was surprised to find that the standard 1000 mAh OEM Lithium Ion battery cost was almost $45.00. That seemed a bit steep, so I began searching here on Amazon.com and found this Blackberry Li-Ion [OEM] C-S2 Battery. Was cautious because of the extreme price difference, but figured that if it was truly an OEM C-S2 battery, it was worth the gamble.Examined it when it arrived, and found that it not only had the original BlackBerry logo, but was marked C-S2 on the face, the correct version for my phone (and many other BlackBerry models). The back listed it as a Lithium Ion Battery, 3.7V, with a capacity of 1150mAh 4.3Wh... identical to my original battery. So it was charged overnight, as had done when the phone was first received with the original battery.It was good choice, as the battery has been a perfect backup to my original. It has function just the same as the original C-S2 battery, and there seems to be no difference. Went on to buy a second backup, just because it seemed to be a good idea for those 'better safe than sorry' situations. Must admit that I do use the built-in GPS quite a bit, and that along with frequent \'Net access, probably accounts for my need of extra battery power. Might note that I picked up anExternal Battery Charger For Blackberry 8300 8320 8330, which has been the perfect compliment to these batteries.One might note that the prices on the BlackBerry C-S2 OEM batteries seem to vary quite a bit here, but most seem to come in well under $7.00... far less that what the cell phone retailers are charging. Do your searching here on Amazon.com and you\'ll find some excellent prices on these.If your battery seems to not last as long as the original specs for the BlackBerry stated, you can argue with the retailer... or waste far less time and get one of these C-S2 OEM batteries here.

However, if you use the adhesive disc for the dash then the charger cord will likely have to be bent at right angles to make the connection, as its receptacle on the GPS points straight down.

Unfortunately, that port is really close to the ball mount which restricts it's movement when plugged in.

I've used this before with my phone and while people may give you strange looks while talking the person on the phone seemed to hear me just fine.I think these are also great to use when a cable often gets in the way.  I enjoy using these if I'm taking a bike ride.  I have an adapter for my ipod which I use with these. My only complaint is if I go to the gym with these on.  I can hear music fine if the volume is up, however if I'm watching a show on my iPod then often times I can't hear much of the dialogue.  So in those situations I end up using my ear buds.  I'd say the sound quality is alright.  I'm not an audiophile but I do usually have a good ear for sound quality.  The battery life on these seems good and I like how they can charge with a standard mini-usb connection.I've had 1 problem that's probably worth sharing.  Between pairing the headphones for different devices I sometimes had an issue and then it wouldn't pair to anything.  So I'd shut them off, plug them into a PC which is powered on.  After a few seconds I'd disconnect it and when I tried to pair them up again it would work.  I am not sure of the cause and didn't try plugging them into a regular power source to see if that fixes it.  So just a warning if any of you come across this problem too.  It doesn't happen every time and isn't a deal breaker for me.'], ['I love it, I bought it at an AT&T store when it first came out for almost $140.00, so you can see that its a great price here. It pairs easily and has excellent sound quality (and I'm extremely picky when it comes to quality sound). I want to buy an extra set in case anything ever happens to these.  They charge fast and work great. Only problem I ever have is without a case, you can accidently turn them on way to easy and when you need them, the battery is dead. The on button is on the right ear and pushes very easy to turn on the unit expecially when you handle them to just move them.  You have to always be sure that the light is not blinking or yo'll drain the battery, whose charging connector comes with a standard small USB connector found on most phones and headsets today.

The device works very well. I simply leave it on the magnetic holder provided which rests on the Visor. I can hear the caller very clearly.  The device is especially good at boosting the volume level.  So I can turn the volume up and hear even the softest voices while traveling on the highway.  On the other side of the call, the callers tell me that the voice quality is pretty good, with a hint of echo sometimes.  Most important, they don't complain about road noise.I leave the device in the car all the time, and recharge it about once a week.  The on-off switch is great.  You flip the microphone down toward you and it is ON.  You flip it back flat into the device, and it is off.  So there's never a mystery about whether it is ON or OFF.I highly recommend this device for anyone who uses the cell phone while driving.  Keep in mind that this device is essentially a speakerphone in the car.

I have also owned and used Blackberries, Treo\'s, LG Phones including the LG VX9800 and the Motorola Razor. I picked one up this week and here are my initial impressions.The phone layout and design are excellent. Compared to other devices like the Blackberry and Treo, the keys are in a much better location (about  up from the bottom end of the phone) making it much less stressful on the thumbs to type. The keys functions are very similar to a Blackberry. Takes a little bit of getting use to but learn very quickly.Active Sync, which it comes with, is a breeze to set-up and start syncing. Works great with Outlook. I also have set-up my device to pull down emails from my gmail account. I read one review that said everything was being doubled when transferring. No so here. Works like a charm and very fast. Internet connections are much faster that on my Blackberry, which my work has supplied me.The battery is another item that people tend to give bad reviews on. That may be why Verizon is currently offering a 60 dollar battery for 19 dollars. Supposedly the extended battery will give double the time which as I understand it from other users is about 2 days.One of the big issues that people are focusing on in these reviews is the processing speed and how it is affected by having multiple applications open and the hassle of closing them once you are done with them. First, the Motorola is like any computer....having multiple applications open and running all at once will kill the processing speed of computer. Second, to close the programs is much easier than represented in these reviews. Just go to your home page and click on the top smart icons Task Manager and 'Kill All' tasks running.So far very happy with my decision.Update: 6/12/06After a week of using my Q, I am still pleased with my decision.  I continue to monitor the other reviews and what I find interesting is the fact that many people focus on items that are very nit picky, i.e. the screen is slightly off center.  Interesting...I didn\'t even notice until that person pointed it out.  What is also interesting is that people tend to want a device that does everything exceptionally well (pda, phone, etc).  I would agree that that would be the ideal but I am happy with a device that does everything good.  Each person has their own preferences and what you really need to keep in mind is what you need the device to do.  I just need a device that syncs with my home computer (outlook), can send text and picture messages, syncs with my email via the web and provides me occasional access to the internet.  The Q does all that and more.Update 6/16/06Ok.  I have returned my phone(s) yes, plural!!  Let me explain why.The first phone had an issue with it\'s bluetooth functionality/transmitter.  I returned it and exchanged for another Motorola Q.My second phone I had for one day before it completely died and nothing I or tech support could do would allow it to be restarted.Motorola has some serious issues to overcome with their Quality Assurance program.When I was on the phone with Verizon Tech Support I asked them which device/Smartphone they recieved the least number of calls on...they said the Treo 700w.  As such, I return my Motorola Q and purchased the 700w.  Wow, what a difference!  The Treo is much faster and much easier to use.  I would downgrade my rating but unfortunately once the stars are choosen in Amazon\'s rating system they cannot be changed.'], ['This phone does every thing I could want from a phone. It EVEN makes calls ;-)  The camera takes a very nice picture and video, and the large display shows it very clearly. You can make your own ring tones from MP3s, though limited in size, its enough for a good long ring. (it would go to voice mail before the song would repeat.) The MP3 player is cheesy, but it plays them just fine (no higher than 192 bit rate) Once I added a 1 gig MicroSD, I was able to convert my music videos and even some full length DivX\'d movies to the phone. (Use SUPER, It is a must for awesome FREE video and audio conversion (Not a plug, just the truth)) The blue tooth works great, and combined with the free Samsung edit software, you have full control over phone content from your PC. The design is very sleek, and fits into a pocket with ease. I could go on and on.. I liked it so much I got a second one for the wife.The But....The ear piece volume is very low. The max setting is 5. It really needs to go to 10. The only other 'whine' I\'d have is if your not careful while sliding it open to take a call, you can easily tap the \'end call\' button and send it strait to voice mail.The PROs really out weigh the CONs by far, I\'d get more of these at the under 80 USD price should I need them :)'], ['After getting myself a new VX8700, I picked up a new VX8300 for my girlfriend. The VX8300 is not the prettiest or thinest phone Verizon offers, but it seems to be one of their best performers. Sound quality, speakerphone, RF, and battery life all seem very good. The camera takes decent pictures. It has just about all the features you expect in a phone today too. With a new contract, you can get it for $50 or less. At this price, I give it 5 stars.'], ['Charges fast and and stays charged for a while, has plenty capabilities and looks good, too.

As a matter of fact, you won't even realize it is there.  One thing I would recommend.  Get the little attachment so you can loop it over your ear.  It is available from Samsung for 5.95 I believe.  Without it, you will have an extremely hard time keeping the headset in your ear.  And, it is so small and light, you may not even realize that it has fallen out.  It will drive you crazy without this piece.  I don't understand why it is not included with the headset - it is that necessary.  I have looked at the more expensive ones.

Is it the best it could be....not by a long shot but it works and that goes a long way.I use it for business calls and have yet to be called on it. That within it self makes it a winner but the Gennum nxZen almost works that good. The difference is I can hear this one with relative ease as opposed to the nxZen. If you boost the microphone (on the nxZen)gain it decreases the in audio which is a issue. I prefer the 'in-the-ear' type headset because I\'m always using it in loud places like airports etc. The built in boom slides forward and provides excellent out audio for the receiver. I still, struggle at times, hearing the caller. The talk time, so far, is very good. I can wear it for several hours but at some point my ear does start hurting.I use this with my Treo 700w. It drops the pairing on a semi-regular basis. It was easy to pair to my original phone but I\'ve not been able to pair it with any other thing.Overall, if you been waiting then wait no more. It\'s worth price.'], ['Nice stylist product.  I am using it with my Treo 700P.  Crystal clear sound quality and different volument levels that suit me (use hearing aids).

I could listen to streaming music with it from my phone and it stayed on my ear really well.  This is the only headset I've had where people could actually hear me all the time.  The sliding boom mic made a big difference.The downfall of this model, as other reviewers have also written, is that the rubber tips that hold the headset on your ear break off with time.  I used superglue and prolonged the life of mine for a while, but it was annoying.'], ['This is a nice looking piece that works well.  Voice quality is excellent, but people I've called report there is sometimes a slight buzzing when I am talking to them, although they can still hear me well.

So after a few hours of reading reviews on a dozen or so different headsets, I finally decided just to settle for the H500, I was really interested in some of the Plantronics sets, but she didn't care for the design.. I was a little worried about the H500 because the reviews are kinda so-so.. They're either good reviews or bad reviews.  I got it for her so she wouldn't have to fumble around in the car with a phone so how it performs in a vehicle was going to be the make or break point with it.  I'm pleased to say that the headset performs way better than I expected it to.Getting started is a breeze.  All you have to do is charge the headset for about 2 hours (the LED light will go off once the battery is charged) once it's done charging you have to pair it up with your phone.  All you do is press and hold the call button until the LED light stops blinking and stays lit, then you have your phone set to hands free mode and follow the simple steps on the phone (For us it was as simple as the phone finding the H500 and entering the 4-digit pin of 0000)  The phone saved the settings and we were all set.Using the headset is no brainer basically.  There 3 buttons; Main call/multi button & Volume up & down buttons.  Pressing these buttons in various combos will yield different results like mute, hold, transfer, 3-way, etc. The retail package comes with a handy fold out that has all the functions and how to access them.The build quality of the headset is great as well.. The headset is about 2 inches from earclip to mic.  Its very small and very comfortable to wear.  The ear clip is removable to you can use it on either ear as well.  The buttons feel solid as well.Now to the actual sound quality.  The headset has performed great in all the scenarios we've tried so far.. Which has been in the house while watching TV, In the car with the stereo & windows up & down & in an office environment.  I was most impressed with how it performed while driving, There is no static or any background noise at all and even with the radio and window down, the user can clearly be heard both ways.  Again very impressive.  The only environment we haven't really tried yet was at the store.  I will update once I've tested that as well.I can't really comment on the battery life yet, because we've only had the unit for a day or so, but so far the unit has yet needed to be charged.So to summarize, great headset overall, feels & looks great, sound quality is super, voices are loud and clear.  Performance in the car, home & office was excellent and the price Amazon offers is great compared to retail.  I'm very very satisfied (and relieved!) that this unit performs as well as it does.'], ['Yes it matches my phone.  Excellent head set, I hear them and they hear me.

Also, the case wraps to the front of the screen and protrudes about 1/16' beyond the glass so it protects the screen if the phone is accidentally slid across the floor or it\'s dropped flat on the glass.  My only gripe is an aesthetic one but that\'s very subjective... and I don\'t think most Galaxy Note owners are very critical about aesthetics.  Hopefully this company makes one for the soon-to-be-released Note 2 as I\'ll be getting one once it\'s released.'], ['I highly recommend this case for the Samsung Galaxy Note.  I have the international unlocked version of the Note, and it fits perfectly.  It's durable and gives me the peace of mind that the phone isn't going to slip out of my hands.  I love the knurled edges that make it easy to grip. The case is also very slim, so you hardly know it's even there.  The case makes the power button harder to press, but I am getting used to it.  I have 3 different style USB cables, and none of them could seat entirely in the socket with this case (the cables would work and allow me to connect/charge my phone, but if you bumped anything, the cable would fall out). I ended up using a dremel rotary tool to slightly enlarge the opening in the case around the USB port, and now all of my cables seat properly.  These are minor quibbles, though.

They don't fit your ear, they echo, callers can't undertand you, the battery dies too quickly...

Sure, I've only made 5 or 6 short calls on it, but it's turned on for at least an hour a day during my commute.My wife could tell that I was calling from my car, but she didn't notice a difference between normal road noise and the Bluetooth reception.The headset fits my ear comfortably.  You probably have already read that this set doesn't insert into your ear canal, but rather rests against it.  I found this to be comfortable, and without any side-effects.  It's even comfortable when wearing sunglasses.I've never heard and echo, nor received complaints of others hearing one.Many reviewers of this and other models seem to dislike the multi-function button.  Well, it's a single button, and it's used to perform multiple functions.  Sometimes you press it for a few seconds, sometimes you just tap it.  I primarily use it for 'on' and 'off'.  'On' takes about 2 seconds, and 'off' takes about 5 or 6 seconds (although I have to admit, it seems to take just a bit longer than I'd prefer...) to turn off.  I'm not sure why some would complain about this feature, as most phones have one...I'm not sure what all the fuss is from other reviewers (more often on other brands...), but this headset seems perfect to me.'], ['This was for my husband.

I am currently using it with my new Samsung a990.The only gripe, which isn't really anything serious is this. I wear the headset in my right ear.

Pairing is not a problem for this headset, once the pairing is recorded in the phone, there are no quirks about pairing it when you need to use it. Distance-wise, it does not conform to the 33ft maximum, but on a personal note, I hardly part the headset with the phone in that distance so it hardly matters according to my intended use. Overall happy with this headset as it has exceeded my expectations to great lengths!'], ['Plantronics makes the best bluetooth headsets you can get for the cost. No contest. I have made the mistake of purchasing Jawbone, Sennheiser, BlueParrot, Motorolla, Blue Trek, and god only knows which others. Plantronics is the only brand I've purchased more than 1 of. While many of these brands cost well over 4 to 5 times what this one does, none of them can compare on battery life, consistency of connection, or all around value. This headset does take some getting used to as the rubber boot on it slightly penetrates your ear, but after a few days you will forget you are wearing it. The only headset I've found that was easier to hear was the sennheiser, but it likes to stop communicating with your phone til you re-pair it and costs about 6 times what this does.Background noise suppression is stereotypical, if there's noise, the person on the other end will most likely hear some translation of it. The mic is not as sensitive as those found in the Jawbone, so doing something productive like washing dishes won't blow out the eardrum of whoever you are speaking with, but they will hear some level of noise(the Jawbone is brutally painful for that!). I think this is the 5th or maybe 6th plantronics I've bought, and I'm sure it won't be the last.On a side note, the battery, under constant daily use, should last you approximately 500 charges, or 1.5 years avg. This is typical for any and all bluetooth headsets. At a cost of less than $20, that means this unit will cost you barely $1 per month, as opposed to $10-15 per month for some of the designer headsets!'], ['I go for comfort when it comes to headsets.  The Plantronics headset is the most comfortable headset I've ever owned, and I will always buy Plantronics. I got this one for my sister she loves it too. I'm getting ready to buy a Plantronics Pro Plus headset, and use my old Plantronics as a back-up.'], ['When I bought my first Bluetooth-enabled phone about 3 years ago the deal included a Motorola Bluetooth headset.  Cool, I thought.  Then I used it less and less, because the thing had to be recharged at home and would only last about an hour.  Soon I thought it was just too hard to use ... hard to put on, and totally weird in that to turn it on you had to take it OFF your ear, flip down the mouthpiece, then put it BACK on your ear.  Whoever designed the thing had no clue how people use headsets.  It also sounded like I was talking from the bottom of a water well.  Whenever I used it on conference calls people would yell for me to go on mute.  So I started asking people in the waiting rooms at airports what brand they had and what brand they liked.  I got so many people who hated Jabra that I didn't even consider it.  I already didn't really care for Motorola, so I started looking at Nokia, which seem to be nice but clumsy, and then I kept meeting more and more people who were in love with their Plantronics.  I have used Plantronics headsets for a long time in the office, after all, that's all they do and they seem to do it well.  I looked at a few Plantronics and didn't find one that jumped out at me, then one day I ran across the Explorer 350.  This was just too good to be true!  Are you kidding me, $49 bucks for a Bluetooth headset made by the top brand?  Then I looked closer and found that Plantronics did something very unique with this headset.  Instead of having to charge it at home, it comes with an extremely cool little clip that either mounts to your dash or hooks to your air vent in your car then plugs into your cigarette lighter.  Now that made sense!  A place to hold the headset where you use it most, always charging, then ready to use in a second or to walk around the rest of the day with it fully charged.  For us road warriors, Plantronics also thoughtfully included a USB charging cable so the trusty laptop will keep your headset charged while you sleep.  You can buy an optional AC adapter if that makes you feel more secure.  So how is it built and how does it perform?  Built like a Hummer!  The main piece is one solid chunk that looks like it is pretty immune to any normal damage while clunking around in your pocket with a lot of coins.  The piece that goes around your ear looks like it is solid as well, and effortlessly switches from ear to ear and slips on with one easy motion.  After the first time, this thing slips on with no thought on my part and instantly is in the perfect position for use.  Operation couldn't be simpler.  Unlike my Motorola with several switches that you had to remember how and what sequence to push them in, the Plantronics has one switch.  Push it in to turn it on, push it in to turn it off, push it in to talk, push it in to hang up, push it in to voice dial, etc.  All you have to do is push.  Want to make it louder or quieter?  Push up or push down.  No-brainer.  I saved performance for last because this is what convinced me to keep it.  After a quick charge I called a friend from my car with the window rolled down.  This is a friend I talk to all the time from my land line.  I said, hey, I just bought a new Bluetooth headset and want to see how it sounds to you.  He said, cool, put it on and I'll let you know.  I said ... I already have it on!  He said the sound was perfect, no background noise of any kind and it sounded at least as good as my landline.  One of the things several of my airport buddies told me they liked about Plantronics is how the durable rubber earpiece fits comfortably inside your ear and blocks out noise ... like annoying flight announcements.  I have to say that not only did I sound perfect to my friend but every call I have been on has been easier to hear than with any other headset I have ever tried.PROS:Sound QualitySuperior constructionEase of usePairing - instant and flawlessPriceComfortCONS:None I could see.  Earns a comfortable 5 stars!'], ['Of all the various brands of bluetooth headsets I've purchased, all of the Plantronics products seem to offer the best value for the dollar.  I have purchased other headsets from Sennheiser, BlueAnt, Trek, Jawbone, Pioneer, Sony, Motorola, and god knows who else. Plantronics has been the ONLY brand that I've been a repeat customer of.  I've gotten the same sound quality out of this $20something headset as I did from the $140+ Jawbone and $160+ Sennheiser!  My advice, simple, order this or any Plantronics headset, take the change and get some new games or apps on that fancy Android handset...'], ['I have tried way too many bluetooth headsets (Motorola, Plantronics, IO Gear, Logitech, Jabra) and found most to be disappointing. IMHO, the Scala 700 right now is the best bang for the buck. This is my second product from Cardo Scala - the first being the 500, which was also a great headset. The 500 had great sound on both ends and was more than loud enough. Most other headsets suffer from earpiece volume that is just not loud enough. Also the lack of noise cancellation and wind noise reduction on the other headsets made them only useful in the office or a quiet car. The Scala 700 windguard technology is not perfect - but performs much better than anything else I have tried. The 700 is about 1/3 smaller than the 500 and performs just as well in every aspect. The buttons and controls are easy to use and intuitive. It takes a little tweaking to adjust the headset for a comfortable fit, but after some bending and shaping of the earpiece, the headset was very stable and comfortable. For the price, this is a very good option.'], ['I bought this for my Treo 650 and so far I'm very impressed. Battery life is great (about 10 hours), charges very quickly, and it's literally so light you forget yo're wearing it. I also appreciate the addition of a PC USB charge cable for travelling lighter. Very nice addition for this price.I've only had it for a week and it is holding up well (you get a padded velcro carrying case too) but my initial impression, to be honest, was that it seemed a little too fragile - again it's very small and light. So I've been skeptical but we'll see how it goes and if I have to return it I'll modify my review.Pairing it up with the Treo 650 was fast and simple. It rings about 1 second after the phone rings also. The volume control on the unit is easy to use and can be turned up very loud. No complaints on the sound quality from anyone - my wife says it sounds a little like I'm on speakerphone but it's clear and understandable.Update: I had a chance to hear my wife using the headset finally and I'm very impressed - I think this headset is a keeper. There's virtually no background noise. I couldn't even tell that she was driving in the car. Absolutely amazing background noise cancellation.Update #2: This battery lasts forever - very impressed - and you really forget yo're wearing this thing - it's that small and light!'], ['I've tried both the Motorola HS810 and the Treo bluetooth headsets, and this by far is the best one. The problem with Motorola is that it doesn't synch with the Treo 650 100% of the time; while the Treo headset has very poor volume (I need to be in a quiet room to hear anything). The Cardo Scala 700 has great fit (it sits right over the ear canal), great volume (even when driving with windows down), and it synchs with the Treo 650 all the time. This is the headset I'd recommend for anyone with the Treo 650.'], ['I was concerned after ordering this device, when I read many reviews that said this device was a cheap piece of plastic that didn\'t fit into their ear properly. When I opened the packaged and first put it in my ear, I thought 'oh no - they were right!'But I then read the manual and after adjusting the 'ear loop' and angling the headset slightly downward, it fit perfectly into my ear! It\'s snug, it doesn\'t flop around at all. It fits in a different way from your traditional 'ear plug' device but in many ways it\'s more comfortable because it\'s not sitting in your outer ear canal but slightly further outside.So if you\'re thinking about ordering this device, I\'d recommend buying it. Just spend a little time getting the fit right and read the manual about how to adjust the ear loop which makes a huge difference.(Functionally the product paired with my Cingular Hermes 8525 phone perfectly - sound quality is fine).'], ['Outstanding headset.  Best I have ever used.  Syncs perfectly with my Treo 650.  One press of the call button locks it onto my Treo for bluetooth operation.  I even use a second one at home with my 5.8 ghz cordless phones and a BTA II scala bluetooth adapter.'], ['I can't even begin to tell you the hell I've been through with other BT headsets and the Treo 650. They all had pairing issues - either they won't pair with the phone or they don't stay paired.  And the volume was not loud enough.  I returned at least 5 headsets until I came across this one.  The sound quality is maybe an 8 out of 10 but the volume is unbelievable, and this coming from a guy that doesn't have the best hearing.  I can actually hear the person on the line - all the time.  Even in noisy environments.  No complaints from people on the receiving end except when I'm in the home and the mircowave oven is running (this will scramble almost all BT frequencies).  Buttons are placed well and they are very responsive.Initial pairing was a breeze and the 700 connects to my phone flawlessly on virtually every call.  In the two weeks I've owned it, I think it failed to connect on two occasions and I make well over 50 calls/day.  This compares to the 75% connect rate I realized with other BT headsets.Battery life is a 10 out of 10.  I charge the headset every day but I often talk 5-6 hours in one day without recharging.  Just amazing!  They claim 10 hours (which it may actually achieve) but I'm amazed it can actually make it past 5 hours.The range is not that great but I can't fault the headset as Treo is known to incorporate substandard BT electronics into their phones - which make the range very, very poor.  Once in a while, if the phone is in my right pocket and headset in my left ear, there is a slight crackling noise.  It's not bad though, but can be annoying.  Pulling it out of my pocket immediately relieves the problem.Whatever you do, don't attempt to test the buzzer feature when the headset is in your ear - the buzzing is LOUD when it's placed right in the ear.  But if you needed to find it if lost in the room, be prepared to make the room very quiet to locate it.  It relies on the internal speaker to create the buzzing sound.Nice to have TWO chargers available in the retail packaging (one standard wall outlet adapter and one USB charger).  The carrying case was useless but a nice add nonetheless.I would recommend this to anyone with a Treo 650.  I'm not sure if this headset will rate as well with other phones but I can guarantee you won't find a better BT headset for the 650.'], ['I purchased these for my laptop which has a defective headphone jack & for use with my ipod's bluetooth adapter (wRevo A100). After a software update to my laptop's adapter I could not be happier with the purchase. As soon as I turn on my laptop, the headphones connect. The sound quality is great and I can easily walk 15-20 feet away with line of sight and not experience distortion. If I go into another room, there will be a drop off, but it reconnects once line of sight is re-established.With the ipod bluetooth adapter, all of the features work: volume control, play/pause & song forward/backward. Worth noting that the forward/backward track function does not work with iTunes.They do get slightly uncomfortable after about 4 hours of straight wear, but after 15 minutes of rest, I'm good to go for another several hours.I have not tried them as headset for my phone, because I don't use them for that, so no review on the microphone.I would not use them for jogging or any exercise due to how that would feel bouncing on the ears, but they stay on really well as I mow the lawn and do other yard work for 2-3 hours.'], ['When I found out my wife was pregnant, I instantly looked to acquire a set of headphones that I could use so as not to disturb the sleeping baby. I had already purchased theMotorola MOTOROKR S9 Bluetooth Stereo Headphones, but those didn't work well when laying down, and they didn't do so great with blocking outside noises. I also had theSony MDR-RF925RK 900 MHz Analog RF Wireless Headphone, which were good at canceling outside noises, but produced so much static and whitenoise that they were useless.When I came across the S805 I went ahead and gave them a try. I'm glad I did. First, note that I would never use these to make phone calls. They can, but they are so big and bulky that I wouldn't even try. Walking around the house with these giant beasts isn't my idea of a good bluetooth talking device. What I use them for is to watch movies/anime and play the PS3.They are hooked up to my Yamaha HTR-5640 Home Theater Receiver using aSony Bluetooth Transmitter and Adapter for iPod and MP3 Players. Unless your receiver has Bluetooth built in, yo'll need a transmitter. Just be sure it supports A2DP. I had theJabra Bluetooth Music Adaptor, but it didn't work with the S805 because it wasn't A2DP compliant.Overall, I love the quality of the connection: no whitenoise, no static. There is the occasional dropped signal, but that's easily and quickly restored. I purchased these in December of 2008, and in March of 2011 they still work like a charm.'], ['This is my first pair of Bluetooth headphones, and I opted for this style because I want a set of headphones for my phone that will truly deliver the music quality and sound that I'm looking for, and I want that to come in a pair of headphones that feel like they're worth the money I paid for them. These headphones easily fulfill both of these desires for me, and then some!These Motorola headphones are NOT lightweight, but they also won't have you feeling overly weighed down, either. They're simply solid-feeling in weight and construction. I read many other reviews of these online, one from an owner who has owned these headphones over the course of at least a year and a half, and who paid over $120.00 for his pair. Considering the price that I got these for (comparable to the prices that I found for these here on Amazon), I feel like I got mine at a steal, at less than $40.00!These Motorola headphones FEEL like they're worth $150.00, and the stereo sound that comes from them is great. The sound is crisp, clear, and has plenty of depth to it for my taste. I didn't find these headphones to be lacking in their production of bass. No, the bass in these ISN'T going to blow your eardrums out, but I like to have all of the sound elements enhance the overall effect of the music, not overpower it.As far as taking calls on these go, there is no obvious microphone on these, but they work great, just the same. My callers had no problems whatsoever hearing me on these, and I could hear them beautifully on them as well. I was told that the audio being received from these was loud, crisp, and clear, and the same seemed to be the case for me as well on the other end of the calls. I've also had no trouble using the operational buttons, and my phone found and paired with these headphones easily. The only thing that I didn't remember when I ordered these, though (completely my own fault), is that I won't be able to wear these to take calls while I'm driving, as traffic laws dictate that both ears cannot be covered and obstruct vital traffic sounds. Oh well. My bad.Overall, I am SO thrilled with these headphones. I always found the single-ear Bluetooth headsets to look a little ridiculous, so I was all too eager to get a stereo set of Bluetooth headphones that didn't look odd or awkward. These headphones ARE large, but they're solidly made, and look like an expensive, high quality piece of audio equipment.

So I did a search for LG stereo headset after I realized my phone did mp3 music and this headset popped up first.  And it showed up first in my search because it deserves to be recognized.  I love this headset.  Even with the stock headphones that come with it I have good loud stereo phone calls and music.  And no, the audio quality with the standard headset is not spectacular, but LG knew that and made it to where you can use your favorite headphones with your cell phone for music.  I owned a Samsung stereo headset to match my SCH-U740 and it did not offer stereo phone calls.  So here are my Pros and Cons for the product as it stands having owned them for 5 months.Pros:+Provides stereo phone calls and music+Goes as loud as yo'd like and then some. I couldn't hear one of my friend's on my Jabra BT8040 but I heard him loud and in stereo with this headset+Volume knob on the silver microphone piece for changing the volume on the fly+Price is awesome compared to a bluetooth stereo headset+Reduces drain on your phone battery by keeping bluetooth signal broadcast off+Call button allows you to call the last number (press once), say a voice command (hold button), or hang up the call (press once again) with my Env3+Designed to work with any set of 3.5mm headphones+Has a spring tension clip allowing you to clip it to your clothing or to your seatbelt+Worked as a hands-free calling device through the stereo and speakers in my car! (Details below)+Lightweight. Could be used for running with the right headphones. I did not test this myself though+I can run it underneath my shirt and clip it to my collar to hide the wire. The wire from the 2.5mm end to the control part looks to be about 2 feet long+No complaints about sound quality no matter where I placed it to talk. Including under my sheets and comforter when I went to bedCons (of course)-Low quality headphone included for mp3 playback-The center control is where the weight is so if it isn't clipped to you and you lean over it will pull on the headphones-Does not have wind reduction properties so windy environments may interrupt conversation-The cord from the 2.5mm end to the silver control section is quite long not including added headphone length.  Keeping it discrete outside of clothing would prove difficult-Only way to mute a call is to mute it on the phone.  Cannot mute the headset microphoneThe cons all have to do with the individual.  I love this headset more than any bluetooth I've ever bought.  And I was going to tell you a story about the hands-free headset in my car.  Well, I have one of those tape to 3.5mm headphone jack adapters that works in cars with tape players.  I was on the road and I didn't want the headphones in so I plugged the 3.5mm adapter end into the headset, inserted the tape, turned up the volume, and made a call.  It worked perfectly!  I was able to turn the volume up on the radio and listen to the call through all of my speakers.  The person on the other end told me that the sound was great until the volume in the car was up so loud that his voice was echoing back into the microphone.  But the best part was that the headset wasn't clipped to me, it was in the passengers seat and I was having a conversation without the person asking if something was different.  My next project will be seeing if my radio broadcasting adapter will broadcast my call through my stereo just as well.  I'll try to remember to update when I know for sure.  Trust me, if yo're not hung up on being ahead of the technological curve with stereo bluetooth this headset will impress you without a doubt.  Definitely one of the best purchases I will ever make and I can highly recommend it!'], ['Works well.

The kickstand is strong, does not feel weak or flimsy, when placing the GN2 inside the case, it snaps in very firmly. as in, you would need like a plastic pry tool to get it out again, and when placing the GN2 into the holster, it fits just fine.So far, there is no dis-colorization (i have the white edition to match the housing of my GN2), the criss-cross pattern isn't fading away, the belt clip is strong and sturdy. I use the belt clip everyday and there are no hints or anything telling me it's going to break any time soon.

Time will tell if the improvements the maker made will keep the belt clip from breaking as the earlier versions of the case did, I will put the case to the test, But so far I am happy with the case.'], ['Looks as it does in the picture! The holster fits perfect on my waist and holds my phone well! I love it!'], ['Nice. Well constructed. Soft lining will not scratch screen.Reversible. Can use with Screen facing in or out depending upon use.As belt clip rotates can install upside down and phone falls out.No stand.'], ['Looks great, feels great on my phone! I get compliments on it! Now the only thing about the holster case is that it does not actually grasp the phone, so even though this is a swivel holster, it would be bad to rotate it 180 degree from the upward position. The good news is, I barely have rotated while it was on my person. ALSO I was a great set of anti-glare screen protectors from the company FREE! so it was awesome.  :)'], ['Works great. Phone fits in well, nothing is blocked by the case. Fitment is perfect. Have dropped the phone a few times and the case took the damage fine. Love the stand.

I got a great product at a low, low price!'], ['This case is the BEST. I have used it now for about a month. I love that the screen side of the phone is protected. I can toss in my purse and not worry that the screen will get damaged. I use the belt clip while at work and it has performed flawlessly. (The clip does pop off if you do not want to use it.)I have use the clip as a stand. This feature is very nice. Recently was addressing cards and found it very convenient  to use the stand and move thru my address book.Very HAPPY with my purchase!!!'], ['Nice sturdy case.  I use this primarily to click onto my shorts when walking.  It stays put and I feel my phone is safe in this case. This case fits my Note II perfectly.I would recommend this case.'], ['I absolutely LOVE this case. It is the best one I've had for my Galaxy Note II. It is very low profile and provides a reasonable amount of protection. The holster is sturdy and holds the phone well.

This is the second BoxWave product I've purchased and there quality is very good.'], ['The color, feel, and has a strong hold to my phone. The kick stand is very nice as well. Easy to install and very easy to remove the phone from the clip.'], ['The product came on time, and the cost was very affordable.I got so many compliments on it, because of the design, very happy.'], ['This case works well and looks great. The clip broke off but with a little super glue it was good as new. My husband loves his case.'], ['This is a real strong rugged case its awesome I would recommend this to anyone who does alot of outside work this is real strong'], ['I bought the Artic Red Frost for Nexus 4. i love the material of this case that makes it strong to hold the phone (hard rubber-type material) the case also covers some parts of the bezel-- enough to not damage the screen when laid on its screen. all of the cut-outs are aligned perfectly. two cons for me was it is hard to press the power button & it doesn't have a good grip. Although it was more ease to press the volume buttons, i had to apply more pressure against the power button. Maybe it is a mistake in creating. With about a week, i kind of got used to it, so it did not bother me much to always notice it. Because of the somewhat slippery back, it sorta makes the hold slippery. While i am speaking of the back, the back makes the phone looks awesome. It is transparent and i can clearly read 'nexus' & 'LG' from the back. it gives the phone a good look. The grip, is not a severe issue, but the level of grip is just less than my other case by GreatShield. I just want to put that out there for other consumers to consider. Another thing i'll add is that it looks pretty cool in sunlight. I can see part of the actual phone through the case while the sunlight makes mostly the edges of the case glisten. To conclude, i will be sticking with this case because of the look, protection, and decent grip.'], ['It's a slip on case that looks good and protects the phone from light drops onto the desk. Just thick enough to keep the lens glass and the display glass from touching when laying the phone down. I also love the diamond patterned grips on the sides of the phone - makes grabbing it on the run real easy, no slipping. For the money, it's a good buy if yo're looking to keep the phone in your pocket without adding a lot of bulk.'], ['Excellent TPU case. Looks great, slim, improves grip, protects the phone from drops on concrete. What more is there to say?'], ['I purchased this case from my girlfriend and her new Samsung Galaxy S4.  She had been using an Otterbox Commuter but was dissatisfied with that case's bulk.  I'm a big fan of TPU cases, so I got her this one and she couldn't be happier with it.  It fits snugly, looks great, covers the buttons (big plus), and isn't so bulky.  While this case is not at all bulky, it still offers protection for the camera lens and screen by having tiny ridges surrounding those parts which keep them from coming into contact with the surface the rest of the phone is resting on.  The fact that this case is so inexpensive just adds to its otherwise perfect rating.'], ['The mix of smooth and ridged surfaces is a nice touch aesthetically and it also helps to keep a nice grip as all smooth can be a bit slippery. The case fits like a glove and all the holes and cuts outs fit the various ports perfectly. The price on this item is hard to beat and it arrived quickly. I haven't tried it with any of the fun NFC features yet, but I'm not anticipating any problems.All in all, if yo're looking for a nice, simple bumper case I suggest you look no further (assuming the price is still good).'], ['Fits like a glove. Adds no bulk to the phone - my GS4 stays slim and light!The kickstand works, doesn't slide around, nice and firm. It clicks shut with two tiny tabs of plastic on either end of the kickstand, so I guess if over time those tabs break then it won't stay shut anymore. But for the moment, the tabs are really tiny and hopefully will not break anytime soon.The only downsides I can find are:a. hard to feel whether or not if you pressed the power/volume button or not, there's no tactile feedback when you push. They do work though.b. the screw(?) that holds the kickstand in place on the back of the case bulges out and makes the phone sit slightly lopsided when you put it on a flat surface facing upward. Not an issue for me, but didn't expect the screw to bulge out the way it does.Otherwise very satisfied.'], ['Simple but looks great!! Does the job, fits well, has a good grip.  I love it and would definitely recommend.'], ['Love this case! It doesn't look cheap, arrived on time, I can place it inside if my change purse wallet with the silver snap closure. It does protects your phone's edges. I recommend this case.'], ['Great cover the fit is perfect looks really good and the price was fair. The company also sent me 2 screen protectors for free they are perfect as well.'], ['I am impressed with this buy.  The color matches the photos and it stands out!!!  I want to buy the other colors they offer on a later date.'], ['This one actually fits and is rigid enough to stay on the phone.  The material is 'gel like' enough to glide in and out of my pocket without sticking to the fabric of my pants pocket.  It is easy to grip and the lip on the front is raised enough to protect the screen if the phone is laying flat on the front.'], ['Nice simple case that fits well. It doesn't bulk up the phone much and looks good. It doesn't mess up my screen protector on the edges.'], ['I tried the flip case and it was nice but always seemed to be in the way when I wanted to take a pic.  This case is great, nice tight fit, and easy to hold onto.  Does not add any bulk to my phone.'], ['We some case for the money. Integrated kickstand works well. No complaints here at all. Very happy with this case'], ['I love the design. So easy to use. I always get the cover with the stand in the back so it could hold when i'm watching movies or browsing.'], ['This case fits perfect and is durable.  My only problem is I wish I would have opted for purple instead (love purple).'], ['I like it, it's easy to put on and take off, and the color goes great with the phone and for the price it costs I bought more.'], ['This cases from box wave are amazing, they fit my Galaxy S4 perfect,  they are one of the best cases I have ever put on my phone and I am a case fanatic I have more than 10 cases from different company's,  but this one's are going to be in my top list.Very good quality also good job guys.'], ['I know it's at a cheap price point, but it has a great fit, plenty of grip, doesn't add much bulk at all, and when I dropped my phone on the pavement it bounced!'], ['First let me say I absolutely adore this case. I got the winter white with kickstand for my white S4. This is my 4th case for my S4 but its also my best case. Absolutely gorgeous! I love the way it looks, good grip on the side, great design on the back partially see through white & fits quite nicely on the phone. Durable enough for me. If you are looking for a low price high quality plastic case. Look no further this is the one. Highly recommended.'], ['This case is good. Not great, but good. I have a screen protector on my phone which gets slightly pushed along the edges by this case, so I do not use this case too much so that my screen protector does not come off. Besides that, it's fine. Simple though.'], ['When I get a new expensive phone I want to ensure I have all the protection I need so I go crazy and buy all I think I need . Good product. Buy it.'], ['I love its look and feel. The color is a bit lighter than the picture, but looks just fine. highly recommend this phone case.'], ['5 stars based on price and protection.This covers every lip of my S4 and doesn't pinch the screen protector I have (Skinomi TechSkin which covers the entire screen, bezel to bezel.I had this case on my S3 until it got stolen -- definitely happy with both purchases. Looks pretty nice too and is simplistic -- the kickstand won't win any gold medals but it serves its purpose.'], ['The item arrived on time.  Perfect fit and feel.  Non slip so i can leave it on the dash or seat and does not slide around on turns.  Price was less than i thought it would be considering the high quality look.'], ['I like the &#34;S&#34; Pattern on the back.  This has a nice grip on the sides and protects the case pretty well overall.  Only con I can think of is sometimes the circular button at the bottom is difficult to press as well as initially starting to use the power button (have to break in the case).'], ['As described this case is a slim-fit ultra protective gel case .  The feel is so nice.  It does not slip out of your hand and the wavy design is very decorative.  This case added a great touch to my S4 phone. An added plus was a free 2-pack screen protector.  Great buy!!'], ['I love this style of case covers! I only use case covers that have the extra grip on the side! this always gives me a good grip and assurance that my phone will not slip out of my hands everthis one looks to be a better quality then few other ebay no name brand S curve cases'], ['Case arrived quickly and just as described. It's a very stylish case. The front is glossy/shinny and the back is a flat/matte. Now I can grip on to the phone without compromising the thin, sleekness of the Samsung S4.  I love the flush design around the power and volume buttons, it keeps the buttons uncovered and easy to access yet difficult to accidentally hit. Great value, awesome find!'], ['I love that's it's slightly clear so I can still see the white phone. It fits snug and is not bulky.'], ['The phone is very easy to hold & fits the phone nicely and the only drawback is that the power and volume buttons are a little hard to press.'], ['It was simple and the same as it appears on the screen. This was for my boyfriend and he likes it'], ['Perfect protection and grip!! I love it for my wife's phone so I bought it for a friend of mine too. He loves it as we'll.'], ['Pros  fits tighly,  provides great protection from dropping the phone.  also covers the power button firmly, which is great because without a case my phone would turn itself on while in my pocket at times.  this seems like a well made case, i would not be surporised if the manufacturer sold this same case under another name at a much higher pricecons.  none so far'], ['Fits great and looks good. I like the fact that it doesn't add much thickness to the phone, but adds grip.'], ['Nothing flashy about this case.  It's basic black, but the good thing is, it's matte on the backside.  Around the edges it's more shiny, which makes it more grippy.  I like that the volume and on/off buttons are covered to keep dust out, but the covering does make the buttons harder to push.  Cutouts are good, not quite perfect, but yo'd have to be OCD to notice.  Seems to be secure, probably would not come off your phone inadvertently.BTW, the blackout case is completely opaque.  The blue Arctic Frost Crystal Slip case is identical to it other than being blue and transparent.Right now, there are a few different prices listed for these.  For me, the actual cost with shipping was around $3, so it's definitely worth that.'], ['I use this case on my phone everyday.  I bought an Otterbox first but then ended up returning it.  I did not like how it bulked up my phone.  This case is slim and sleek and looks great on a black S4.  Not sure if I would buy it for a white phone.  It also provided a little grip to but easily slides in a pocket.  Can highly recommend this case.  It provides protection and looks great.'], ['This is a basic rubber case that does the job.

Perfect for someone who doesnt want a flashy but nice case.'], ['Got this for my mom, because she'll never go out and get one for herself, (typical moms.. lol..) and she loves it.'], ['This is a snazzy looking case that fits the Samsung Galexy S4 perfectly.  Got this for my wife and she like the feel of the case.  Good protection and looks great.  Maintains the slim fit and feel of the S4, but now much easier to pick up and hold.'], ['I'm in love with the case. Flexible without being that annoying rubber material. Easy on and off. Everything works with case on like camera, flash, sensors, charger and all buttons. Lightweight and no added bulk! Thank you!!'], ['I ordered the Blackout and the Airwave (also by BoxWave) because I could not decide which one I wanted. They both fit my Galaxy S4 just right, nice and snug. They are not bulky which I like. They are not rigid plastic, both are flexible (but not flimsy) but the Blackout case is a little more flexible than the Airwave. These cases cover a little more of the front of the phone than the other case I was using which is nice because it covers the side edges of my screen protector, Tech Armor Ballistic Glass, but without interfering with the viewing area of the screen. By the way it fits great with that screen protector so I don't think anyone would have any problems with other screen protectors as this one is a little thick since it is glass.  You do have to push a little harder for the side buttons but that does not bother me. All openings on the case line up perfectly.'], ['This case is well made and fits very well, I like the color, some black cases look very cheap but this one doesn't.  I'm very happy with this case and would recommend it to anyone.'], ['Case has a simi hard back with a rubbery trim edge.  The rubbery edge sticks up far enough that you don't have to worry about the screen when you lay the phone face down.  The phone fit snugly in the case and everything lined up perfectly.  I thought my other case which was a gel case was nice but this is alot better than the all gel case.  So far I'm loving it and will definately recommend it to my friends.  Overall outstanding case.'], ['I have had the Galaxy S4 for a few weeks now and I have decided to buy a cheap case to protect it from scratching and cracking the screen.  I was a little skeptical at first when purchasing this case because I wasn't sure it would satisfy me. Before purchasing this case, I looked on Amazon to see what other cases there were and all of them were sort of expensive and I just wanted something that would get the job done while not being too expensive and this was the best case I could find.After getting the case, I can safely say that there's no other case out there that can beat this case in price. If anybody out there is not sure what case to get that will keep their Galaxy S4 protected then you have found the one. This case makes the phone comfortable to hold in hand and doesn't add much bulk to the phone. It fits perfectly with the phone. One little thing that bothers me is that the buttons (power and volume) are a little hard to press but other than that, it's hard to beat the price of this case.Pros:+ Makes the phone comfortable to hold in hand+ Doesn't add much bulk to the phone+ Fits the phone perfectly+ CheapCons:- The power and volume buttons are a little hard to pressOverall I am happy with the purchase I made and I'm enjoying this case. I am always very careful with my phones and rarely ever drop them. I don't need an expensive case but just one that will do the job. I hate having scratches on the back of the phone or cracks on the screen. I recommend this case to anyone who's looking for a cheap case that will protect their phones without spending much money on an expensive case.'], ['Let me start off by saying, like so many others reviewing this fabulous product. I bought this case just to tide me over until I could find a better higher quality one. I already have an Otterbox Commuter, but I like to have several cases. One that provides the most protection for when I'm at work, and others that are smaller and don't add so much bulk. Plus, I am somewhat of a case-whore. I had 12 cases for my S3.I thought this case would be a suitable temporary case until I could find another one. I was wrong. This is just a good case period!Like I said, I prefer slim fitting cases so as not to detract from the over-all slimness of this device. I also prefer the soft gel feel of these types of cases to the hard plastic of others. I find it provides better shock absorbancy and just feels better overall.This is the highest quality case I have ever bought for $1.75 ($4.25 shipped).Service-I ordered this on a Sunday night, and paid the minimum shipping price. I fully expected that it wouldn't show up for a week at least (the fourth of July was the following thursday). When I got my confirmation email from Amazon they said that estimated arrival date would be the 6th-9th. Thus, I was pleasantly surprised to find the case waiting for me in my mailbox Wednesday afternoon. Took two days to get here. Very nice.Quality-As I said before, I am very impressed with the quality of this case for the price. It is the soft gel feeling plastic, with a glossy finish on the sides and top and a matte black grippy finish on the back. The back is nice because when you set it on your dash board it doesn't try to slide off. You can't really see it in the pictures but it's there and very noticable in person (but not in a bad way).Needless to say, this case is a very tight fit on the phone, and everything lines up perfectly. I've noticed that sometimes on these kinds of cases that cutout for the charging port won't be quite large enough and the usb cable won't plug in all the way. That's just  the trouble with these plastic molds sometimes. That is not the case here. Perfect fit. ALL the ports are perfectly cutout.As for the power and volume buttons, instead of being covered and thus harder to press they are cutout as well. They also fit perfectly and are not hard to press at all. That camera and speaker cutout is perfect as well.This case fits the phone so perfectly it's unbelievable. Its not so tight as to be hard to get off and on but it is snug. Sometimes when I'm peeling it off it will try to take the battery cover too, which isn't a bad thing in my opinion.Conclusion-Once again this case is the highest quality case I have ever bought for this low of a price. It keeps the phone slim but also provides the needed protection that you bought it for. Awesome, awesome case. I plan on checking out more products by this company.Overall, for less than five dollars out the door you will not find a higher quality case for your shiny new Galaxy S4.'], ['I would defitnetly buy this case again it's awesome & so small that it doesn't even feel like it has a case on,'], ['Item is sleek with a simple design. It fits my Galaxy snug.Simple to take off, if my chance you have to access your batt.or mem.card. Product feels good and has a nice grip. Make sure to grasp it properly because the case and phone is light. I can access all points, w/o anything blocking on my phone. Plus, great price, I have no complaints.'], ['I , like many others ordered it as a back-up. It is really far better than that. I hate cases that cover up the power buttons and volume rocker. This case has very nice cutouts for both allowing for direct access. It's very plain so if it's sexy yo're looking for, look elsewhere. But it fits snugly and provides decent protection. Good job BoxWave.'], ['Simply put, this is the best mobile phone case you can possibly buy for $2 + shipping...period!It\'s a very well designed solid TPU skin case with excellent fit and finish, and precisely placed cutouts for power, volume, earphone, micro USB/charger, mic and sensors. The grip is superb...your phone will never feel like it\'s slipping from your hand, and it\'s slim-fit and matte\' finished back will preserve the slender form factor of your elegant Galaxy S4, and with none of the bulk of the multi-layer \'body armor cases\' on the market. It doesn\'t offer the \'bomb proof\' protection of an Otterbox Defender, but it doesn\'t claim to.It\'s a simple, elegant, but protective case that unless you\'re James Bond should suit your needs perfectly.On the other hand, 007 has always been style conscious. So yeah, I think he\'d like one, too!UPDATE: I\'ve been using this case with my Samsung Galaxy S4 for just over a week, now, and would like to revise my opinion of it. It\'s not only the best mobile phone case you can possibly buy for $2 + shipping, it\'s also the best mobile phone case you can buy for $5.00 + shipping, the best mobile case you can buy for $10.00 + shipping, and maybe even the best mobile case you can buy for $15.00 + shipping, too! I returned an Otterbox Commuter I\'d bought with the phone, and ordered another one of these, 'just in case'. I really couldn\'t be more pleased with this product!'], ['Amazing value for a quality case.  Protects all sides (similar cases from other manufacturers do not protect the top and bottom edges).  Some complain about the buttons being hard to press - while it is slightly stiffer with the case on, you can still feel the click of the button when pressed.

I had first tried the Dzitronic case which was very good, and seemed to be slightly thicker, and felt slightly heavier, but offered great protection. This case is more convenient for daily use since it is lightweight, and offers good protection.
