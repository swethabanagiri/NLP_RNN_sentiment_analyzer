 good product usb cable work perfect like oem cable. . . 
 well, went internet first....$14.00, well known store, gloucester, ma, $28. happy. then, course, knew amazon would come something...they did, $4.00 change...it arrived promptly. cannot say enough amazon, realistic prices, knowing people kind money pay wire,,for 14 28 dollars. never happy get need without spending last dollar it. thank again. 
 would like extra cable smartphones work, purchased one. nothing special long working, is.no complain. 
 difference usb cables. computers, including mine, usb ports underpowered, poor cables transmit data well. purchased cheaper cables would transmit data computer blackberry storm 9530. cable works great, even underpowered usb ports. 
 phone cord easy use easily connected phone computer. great value price. 
 cable better original. never issues phone recognizing usb connection, original does, plugged pc. 
 bought recently expect much, $2.99 shipped door. much money, go wrong? so, used transfer data yet, plugged pc work charging. plugged in, palm pixi prompts me, factory cable does, transfer charge. used cable 10x charge now, works great! hesitate purchase need another cable, two! 
 good inexpensive cable works like original. purchased cable wanted one would work touch stone purchased. reading several reviews looking competing cables deciding one. several inches shorter (40") original works well touch stone. used cable mainly use car. 
 much say wall charger except charges bluetooth perfectly. i'm glad bought it. thank you! 
 charger trick. charger car doesn't work ignition off, wants dangling cord hanging field vision driving.have charged t505 since got it, battery life reported around 18 hours usage 30 days standby. may charge every couple weeks. convenient accessory. 
 motorola t505 doesn't come ac charger, dc charger. makes great addition package. charge home night. 
 initially leary purchasing item due extremely low price free shipping also, needed wall charger since motorola includes car charger wireless car phone speakers. took chance (due low price free shipping) pleasantly surprised. charger appears well made market chargers purchased previously e-book reader, pda, camera, etc., less 25% cost. charged motorola speaker without problems. 
 bought charging cord t505 came car charger. 2 t505 2nd one intended use connecting bluetooth enabled phones home stereo. cord offers convenient way charge car long enough periods device charge completely travelling. bringing devices able charge overnight full charge. great price complaints receipt material either packaging transit time. 
 it's true! cable outperforms original! charge phone, it's chargier. data datery phone phoney general. wear cable around neck like bolo tie, people like better run faster jump higher. circle dinner plate it, food tastes better. basically cable makes everything better original. i'm thinking getting 2nd one! 
 clearly htc cable blackberry logo bulk packaging label says blackberry...but it's oem micro usb cable none less works perfectly micro usb device plugged into.while haven't tested it's speed cables doubt outperforms oem cable works that's asked it.the cable bit thick result stiff unmanageably so.it also noted cable shown picture actual product, mini usb cable appears quite bit longer product, cable 1m long. 
 trust htc accessories htc phones bad luck aftermarket products cheaper, cheap expensive. 
 i'll never understand one review say item works exactly next complains working...for exact phone! don't get it. decided try despite people said didn't work, i'm glad did. it's exactly expected wanted. actually bought 2 could leave one car one work. $4 change both...this great buy never worry incredible running battery! 
 use cord charge phone pc work works great. doesn't charge super fast charges none less. 
 product great value price. works like suppose to. can't beat it. always need extra cords.

 much say, here. little charger works well lot less expensive sprint store. 
 replace cord first one purchased month ago, one great. 
 works great. longer cord one got phone. would recommend item. 
 power cord great replacement standard dual use cord comes phone. dual use, mean, standard cord comes phone usb data cable dc power plug end. sometimes using phone one twist tug line cable disconnect dc power supply, imagine cause data cable short time also may ruin battery. phone companies got cheap decided stop sending phones power cable data cable separately, end, go get standard power cable...like one, fine...quality-wise price-wise. yep. oh, big red light comes plug wall, whether phone plugged not, one nit picky sleepers needs completely dark room sleep, stick small piece black electrical tape light, brighter may think. 
 we've month it's working great. wish cord little longer it's much longer one get phone.

 using coby ca-747 cassette adapter 2 years use car stereo play audio dvd-player cd-player. lately, car tape player kept rejecting out. thought broken buy product amaonz again. reading people's reviews, bump r. penny's feedback 10/26/05 "skip" mode following:"one thing keep mind using product like - (but all) car tape players "skip" mode. tape player's "skip" mode active, listens silent portions tape. detects silence seconds, automatically go fast forward "hears" sound again. tape player "skip" mode, sure cancel mode - i.e., put player "normal" play mode. otherwise, find tape player trying "fast forward" silent portions audio feed."this exactly problem having. turning "skip" mode car tape player, car tape player reject coby cassette adapter anymore.again, even indeed broken, buy product again. good product money. 
 bought cassette adapter replace old one who's cord got ripped half stuck door. get better sound one one originally bought twice price.the best part cassette adapter cord coiled, stretched super long (probably least 8 feet although checked) yet tension applied (during normal use storage) cord 3 feet long. keeps getting stuck things like car doors wrapped around steering wheels getting tangled old adapter did.i pleasantly surprised adapter. got money's worth it. 
 works great 2002 honda accord! adapters either gimped frequency range come one speaker. 
 kicks "local order" 2am monday morning said package would still arrive monday. didn't believe it, figured, "i'll pay doesn't arrive time i'll get money back shipping cost" (i mean come on, 300 miles south me!!). 12 hours later package come 300 miles onto doorstep. friends dedication one's time commitment. wow.as far product goes love it! plug stretchy spiral type doesn't hang around getting tangled feet i'm driving. way better last stupid cheap one bought best buy cord wore 2 months. sound quality really bad learn adjust volumes properly. everything expect cassette adapter.in order get volumes adjusted optimal sound quality (without white noise tape players give off), adjust phone mobile music device 75% volume keep plugged in. point use car's volume amplify volume.good luck!

 would agree majority reviews. purchased car. don't mp3 connection tape deck. wasn't thrilled quality sound fm tuners (my brother one car). little bit clicking sound appears starts playing, road nose general nose car, non-issue...can't even hear it. quality sound good direct mp3 connection, consider good...(not sure it's even fair compare). use primarily audio books, happy purchase. try fix reviewers (something needing take pin inside cassette).i would definitely recommend! 
 car doesn't ipod connector bought product. using year happy it. works amazingly well.

 overall, think it's safe investment mobile phone. one sad thing cell phones improve quickly, there's always race best.right now, phone one best, without 300+ pricetag. you're paying 300 it, aren't getting good deal.clear reception, included ear piece comfortable generics come phone like r225 samsung.great display. downside wiping thing. oils form skin ear show easily pristine surface. clear pictures nice graphics.i give 10 10. 
 i've mine almost two months i'm happy aspects wonderful powerful phone. definitely buy another s-e phone future. still don't like t-mobile's coverage especially service support, phone star. may find teh buttons bit small, well-spaced fine large hands. voice clarity superb me, quality/durability great. 
 used se t610 phone almost 2 months palm zire 72 hp ipaq 4155, must give 5 stars following reasons:1) camera great. pictures come real clear beautiful send via email. please don't judge quality pictures see t610. admit pictures look little fuzzy t610. 2mb memory purpose taking pictures upload send via email others. quality pictures improves dramatically sent viewed via one's pc.2) bluetooth features phone outrageous. paired se t610 using t-mobile's unlimited vpn gprs data service palm zire 72, hp ipaq 4155, logitech mobile wireless bluetooth headset performance great. got bluetooth enabled palm pocket pc, phone you. sony ericsson ground floor bluetooth revolution. send data via pocket pc palm se t610 via bluetooth flash. moreover, web surfing much faster thought via bluetooth.3) absolutely problem signal strength clarity voice calls nyc primarily use phone. go boroughs queens, bronx, manhatten, brooklyn nassau county (with exception garden city) great.people need realize t-mobile extensive network verizon even sprint has. so, looking buy phone use t-mobile network, enthusiastically recommend live nyc (outside staten island). however, need due diligence check advance whether phone perform well service provider area live. 
 i've t610 + tmobile month (so word rebates yet) phone service... i've pretty satisfied. get pretty good reception everywhere... phone small comfortable everything seems work without hitch. camera good enough cell phone... phone pleasing got new games/themes/ringtones via infrared port. phone doesn't much memory deleted predefined themes/songs/graphics (or least ones lets you), gave enough. hasn't frozen yet (and mine came oldest firmware). heard upgrading firmware resolves freezing issues, increases quality/compression pictures, overall makes phone useable... none things affected like others, haven't looked upgrade it. unfortunately, cant update firmware yourself... two friends also package pretty happy it. think reviews people who've negative experiences... 
 good product. quick shipment provided vendor item exactly described. satisfied purchase 
 excellent replacement battery, fit fine price amazing. anyone needing replace old battery won't hold charge totally look getting one these! 
 item working good. phone problem power battery neither. 
 i'd bought battery bought cell phone, would've cost much, much more. didn't need new phone - new battery - instead adding another used cell phone trash heap, i've recycled used battery kept phone really like! phone works like new! 
 bought try repair pos dash cam, even though battery great issue... fit perfectly accepted charge should. 
 works great. i've using year, seems hold charge good oem (it oem) 
 love compact design fit ear rest. barely tell wearing thing. mic picks great! using thing time keeping spares car bluetooth gets fussy... 
 cheapest headset ever purchased, yet best small headset ever made. lasts forever! bought xbox live works great cell phones too. says made plantronics description headset says verizon side i'm sure deal know works great. you're looking nice regular headset xbox live microsoft headsets break time cell phone, buy headset. went ahead bought another one they're sold out. try buy oem planet got stock, best opinion. 
 don't know, i've always liked high-tech loved idea bluetooth, even though tends make one look like space alien contacting mother ship blathering fool someone notices bluetooth unit ear.but i've never gotten good reception bluetooth units enough batter life. don't get started static wind noise.that's money can't better wired units. they're lightweight, comfortable, ample cord length. i've ordered several, you'd pay 3 times price bog-box electronics store. favor, even bluetooth, keep one one hand. well worth price. 
 it's perfect us don't smartphones headphone jack. sound quality excellent makes multitasking much easier. long wire put phone pocket problem. 
 purchased total 3 far.. 1st one sound seller replaced immediately.. others purchased use co-workers instead $50.00 apiece ones given verizon purchase.. stay ear work well... 
 liked much even broke user wanted product replacement. ordered 3. 
 purchased one headsets many years ago happy it. well, husband tried decided needed since lot driving work. happy see still available much better price paid way back.i love use cordless phones well cell phone. prefer corded sets, seem better sound quality. love earpiece fits snuggly around lobe. wear glasses works great. go style one wraps around head, depends handset pick up. highly recommend anyone prefers corded headset. 
 i've bought 20 things now, shared many friends & family, rave them. it's comfortable fits ear, sound quality (especially noise cancellation mic) *stellar* - driving noisy freeway person listening *never* know you're car.i tried several bluetooth headsets thoroughly unimpressed: charge them, add latency, add extra compression artifacts, audio clips you.this headset disadvantage wire, it's also 1/20th price bluetooth headset, won't give cancer. (ever since got large benign osteoma skull after, suspiciously, 6 months heavy cell phone use, i'm bit paranoid cell phone radiation).the jack smaller size (2.5 mm), unfortunate, smartphones days 3.5mm (so plug headset headphones). so, got smartphone, ended buying half dozen adapters, love headset much. 
 ony draw back product corded. could make product wireless would exceptional. love it, great sound, cofortable ear plays different ringtones callers know whos callings. 
 old style flip phone uses 2.5mm plugs. works well clipped ear use chat hands free. 
 like people owned multiple styles headsets varying degrees success them. plantronics cs50 simply best unit ever used. unit worked desktop phone answering system office. phone every day 6 hours rough day.i got tired holding phone ear office hours 50 feet away desk missing important call waiting for. device solved problems. headset unit gives call answer end control fingertips well volume mute control. gave remote ring detection allowed 300 feet away desk catch important call. would operate 8 hours desktop control stand charged headset meeting lunch.i used plantronics hl 10 handset lifter touching button headset could answer phone remotely ease. sound going ways excellent never issue unit. designs tried always clear people would complain could hear me. unit. noise cancelling mike cushioned ear piece made excellent communication comfortable wearing long hours day.the unit fast recharge time 3 hours 100 % full charge empty. headset extremely light comfortable phone transmission digitally encrypted security privacy. first tool would buy setting new office today. great! 
 clear transmission calls incoming outgoing. easy integration current phone system. would buy needed. 
 mine died needed new one. works perfect like old one. good product would recommend anyone. 
 bought son say: &#34;this great case held phone waterproof whole cold weekend trip. whole pack got wet case kept phone dry. would recommend anyone needs tough waterproof case.&#34; 
 got otterbox hold valuables pool summer. perfect size need completely waterproof crush proof. put paper inside held water dry bone. 100 pound son stand nearly 200 pounds crack. 
 durable, water tight, use backpack keep medical supplies dry, clamps hold tight solid click shut 
 one filled charging cables (both dock lightning) iphones ipads, car chargers, wall chargers everything needed power mobile devices traveling... conveniently placed easy grab we're going anywhere, knowing don't worry forgetting anything cannibalizing cables around house. keeps everything safe, secure dry. 
 ..and i'm europe, phones networks much better states. say think samsung currently best software (and used huge nokia fan). amazingly light, intuitive, great audio, looks great. recommend without reservations whatsoever. 
 pretty much worth (if sign plan get phone $250). otherwise little pricey. gain enough make feel good buying though, plan anyway remorse there. it's difficult tell picture i95 bigger - less bulky. features little better. course gps nize. 
 i've glanced reviews looked overall review phone, think it's little underrated. i've couple weeks try mine, battery life usage 3-4 days, use phone short calls 5 times day. phone doesn't squeak squeezed, construction tight (even flip screen doesn't wiggle much). saw complaints weight phone, even complaint metal battery panel. it's called quality, sometimes quality weighs little, phone makes pants fall it's hooked onto jeans, buy belt. phone employs java applications, download programs fit needs nextel, cost. also get third party sites, also ringtones, wallpaper, etc. phone uses gps, locate approximate position free, software give directions one location another free (navigational software), called telenav. quality speakers microphones phone great. speakers loud enough hear different rooms house, quiet enough barely hear them. sound crisp, even direct connect. also, answer slams nextel itself, don't listen it. problem tech support operate 24/7, customer service good service based organization i've ever worked with. phone full featured, isn't exactly pda phone, it's software capability 65k color screen make perform many functions pda. great phone, nextel services area, won't disappointed. 
 high initial cost (i got put promotion, duh), really love compact stylish phone. it's best nextel offered yet, although there's rumor camera phone coming soon. wait, wait bit longer, otherwise walkie-talkie style cellular, nextel best. delays like verizon (up 30 seconds!) sprint (10 secs). walkie-talkie actually works there's coverage. i'm happy customer. 
 say great phone nextel service great also.as review moron denver need used service open mouth make fool self.people review something clue goes show stupid people breed.i i90c,i95cl i730 730 great alarm buy clock need alarm.the screen little smaller brilliant color makes it,the sound good phones had.as service every carrier state colorado nextel best one thinking verizon push talk well sould push wait.if want best phone service best. 
 first quick confession: like t-mobile. hated (lack of) coverage bad service.that said, v300 good phone. won't rehash long feature list here. really like (after playing friend's) loud ringtones, good reception (despite lack gsm coverage brooklyn), great styling. phone made motorola per se asian partner, maybe explains &quot;girlish&quot; styling, it's still pretty cool. course, light weight good battery life make stand-out.my favorite phone still sanyo vm-4500 video camera walkie-talkie speakerphone cell phone sprint pcs... 
 recently used two plug trip. used one chile argentina worked perfectly. would recommend set. 
 look cheap work great. took trip china problems all. 
 update:the person actually using adapters (an 80 year old grandma) reported bassano italy worked find charged phone issues. octogenarian deal something, speaks volumes product!in case, using iphone overseas, issues power converters moot. plug us style plug adapter. even so, work own. plus!**********************************these little adaptors look like well made price right.i add get back! 
 bought trip europe (netherlands) worked perfectly without kinks. quite pleased purchase. 
 happy purchase. returned europe trip used convert charge electronics (iphone, ipad 3) impressed.i concerned might fry ipad 3, assured italian gentleman electronics store, would fine, was!so recommend this. 
 bought set adapters specifically trip europe. two different europe plugs, took both, worked everywhere went.i used adapters primarily denmark norway, worked great gave problems charging ipod, iphone, ipad, camera batteries, etc.note numbers plugs, numbers correspond cardboard insert let know use plugs. would better plugs information them, least numbers (which didn't see first put numbers them).i undoubtedly keep using adapters future trips, i'll keep updated.update:have also used thailand, worked great. 
 works supposed to, lightweight, compact, economical. covers nearly every plug ive ever needed asian except india. 
 it's problem charging mobile devices you're driving, since devices charged usb port, either built vehicle (newer models) usb chargers fit vehicle's power port (aka cigarette lighter). lot small electrical appliances made work ac power, devices, 12-volt in-vehicle power inverter answer. bought dedicated power adapters laptop computers, expensive usually work particular model laptop. tried sabrent 75-watt inverter subaru, worked fine providing ac usb power. used two ac-powered camera battery chargers aa battery charger:canon g10 battery charger - 14 wattsnikon d3200 battery charger - 20 wattsmaha aa battery charger - 16 wattsi also used inverter charge hp laptop using laptop. laptop uses maximum 50 watts running, well inverter's limits. using inverter ac devices, also recharged android smartphone 1a usb charging port.one caution: every vehicle's electrical system maximum rated power deliver vehicle's power port. subaru forester, owner's manual says 120 watts. trying power device devices exceed limit likely blow fuse. also note subaru sells 100-watt power inverter vehicle, costs $300, sabrent inverter small fraction amount.for anyone need ac power vehicle, sabrent inverter good option consider. inverter also available 150 watts (sabrent 150w power inverter 2.1a-1a dual usb charger 12v dc 120v ac (pw-c15u)) 300 watts (sabrent 300w power inverter 2.1a-1a dual usb charger 12v dc 120v ac (pw-c30u)).a product sample provided manufacturer review purposes. 
 i'm standing room tv blasting, 10 feet away. talking hertz reservations - tell (a) voice clearest one heard day (b) don't hear tv all. replace unit old earphone. "now voice sounds muffled", said, "and hear tv loud clear".i stories like this. walking busy noisy street - etymonic makes voice clear noise traffic wind. old earphone almost seems exaggerate background noise.i use foam ear piece comfortable stays place. don't like hard plastic ear pieces.nice. 
 far best wired wireless headset i've ever used (over dozen). comes headset, medium length cord 2.5mm plug, small large windscreen, 2.5mm-line in/ line adapter pc carry case, plus 3 different sized earplugs cleaning tool. use 4-5 hrs per day averagepros:very high quality speaker. like high quality headphones, phone good signal sounds great, you'll hear lots distortion poor signal. use blackberry 9650 femtocell - sounds good high quality landline. didn't sound good htc samsung (cdma) phones, indicative quality phone's voice circuitry.great noise cancelling microphone - windscreen on, use outdoors even strong wind (20 mph). background noise muted callers usually amazed cell.works glasses hats - unit held place friction. it's light enough works well. makes great outdoor activities.cord perfect length designed work phone belt clip pants pocket. form factor great takes little space.surprisingly, friction alone holds unit place. pretty durable (sitting dropping it)cheap - $35, performs much better jawbone/plantronics bluetooth variety without radiation risk outperforms high end corded headsets (call center sets, theboom)cons:2.5mm plug. every modern smartphone uses 3.5mm. time update.uncomfortable itchy extended (4-5 hrs) use. plugs made soft plastic need air ear hours (no discomfort then) 
 blueparrott, keep forgetting turn bluetooth on, paired something else i've wishing wired headset noise cancelling ability long while. it.on motorcycle can't hear engine, windscreen good low speeds (sans windshield - 30 mph smaller windscreen starts letting noise through. can't hear stereo blaring. would say slightly less able blueparrot - might boom doesn't quite reach corner mouth. problems noise coming right angle.it isolating insert blocks external noise (you might need earplug ear really noisy environments).a nits:they cases windscreens - tend get squished. stereo dual mono version would welcome. boom could bit longer.only negative don't include ipod/blackberry/(some)android 4 conductor 3.5mm adapter, already several. voip adapter.so maybe perfect, way beyond "handsfree" wired headsets used, isn't expensive does. 
 bought usb hubs past, failed. plugging 2 powered devices would make work.this usb hub 4 usb powered hard drives external dvd burner plugged work without problems! one best hubs found. 
 usb port sleek functional. plug play. even come power supply case power hungry peripherals. even though works fine without power supply chose use recommended manufacturer. comes lifetime warranty. cyperpower ups reliable expect little cyber wonder nothing less.

 use product 6 months great job, dlink used another system kept losing connection middle transfers threw away, one works.i use lots usb devices two one computer work fantastic. copy movies personal video player network hard drives never fail. ones would stop sending packets middle trasfer. 2 printers, 2 scanners, video capture, mouse, keyboard, tv, external hard drives, 2 flash card readers, docking sandisk mpeg player, docking ipod player, external game system updating firmware, wacom drawing board adobe cs3, attachments hook off. hubs always works.downside, ive learn tricks windows xp keeping track drive letters changing around, third party programs tried i'd rather use disk manager myself.you need little cable management unit small volume cables attached physically push around, cable ties electrical take easily takes care problem. 
 really like hub. acer one netbook, use hub power cd/dvd external drive, laptop cooler pad, 1tb external hard drive. cooler pad also usb ports, 4-in-1 memory card reader plugged that. everything works fine. sometimes unplug cd/dvd drive get netbook read properly. problem another hub though, think it's drive. works often hub though.this small. main picture makes look huge, it's really palm sized. took vacation, fit fine carry-on. don't need keep stand it.i also like one port front need plug usb drive. 
 use hub mac great. plugged usb port macbook pro never problem it. optionally power device included ac adapter, lights bunch green lights one brilliant blue light top green lights. blue light extremely bright size may need covered sleeping room it. plenty open slots additional devices. using device vertically stand front usb slot attach flash drive without effort. everything (at least mac) recognized ready go plugged in. would highly recommend hub - can't find anything nice price powered. 
 older computer ony 4 usb ports laptop 2 usb ports. 4 external drives printer various devices require usb, disconnect one computer plug everything works great. far small flash drives require external power idea. hope reviewer elaborate that. case well worth money. stays forever lit, thats okay. look funny 10 years lights extinguished.

 little hub seems brand blow ports. terrific dental op's running digital equipment. provides local hub source top cabinet computer located underneath. easy access, works well inexpensive. sure use port camera port digital x ray sensor label ports. 
 use macbook connect several items time including usb keyboard optical mouse, ipad iphone, webcam, external hard drive even light rama controller christmas lights. thing works great provides plenty power devices. haven't seen slowness webcam, ipad/iphone syncing even copying large movies external hard drive. guy works great disappointed performance. however bit disappointed design. sit corner desk need plenty room sides allow usb cables plug in. would design like tower plugs back one top another. said, current design offer added stability keep hub falling over. overall great performer decent design. 
 surprised find excellent powered usb hub much less money paid identicel one three years ago. somehow, misplaced power adapter ordered one mainly could get power adapter. older hub still works fine use adapter run usb 3.0 hard drives tv android mini-pc. grandson wanted hub playstation 3 slim, sees lot use. uses video gaming multi-media center. accidently damaged one two usb ports limited one usb port.i gave hub. happy friends want one!

 product appears genuine original equipment blackberry car charger. blackberry name logo it. plate bottom cigarette lighter plug unit states electric output 5 volts, 500ma (500 milliamperes .5 ampere). plate wall charger packaged new blackberry 8800 states wall charger output 5 volts, .75 ampere. thus, appears car charger produces two thirds electrical charge produced wall charger (.5 vs. .75 amp.)this car charger used blackberry 8800 performed admirably without problems. costs fraction price charged at&t; ($29.99), apparently product.

 received item timely manor, best thing product, outstanding response received seller. excellent purchase experience excellent customer service. would buy seller again. unable make item work blackberry 8310, seller provided opportunity return full refund, however, life got busy time alloted return expired, that's fault seller. 
 headset sounds excellent. earbuds aggravate ears in... even long lengths time. would definitely recommend these. 
 update: i've asked hold sweat (see below). problem working sweat treadmill, must stress i've put summer run. also must say expect longevity non-sweatoroof product, s11 headphones designed sweatproof nano coating. however, since asked, still sound work excellent. bounce around running, it's intolerable... ideal. battery: i've used every day since got them, often times days house studying day going gym. last morning night constantly connected. often forget i'm wearing turn music don't hear sound phone/tablet.edit: record, motorola site says working (under questions product, says sweatproof kept away moisture). i'm going work anyway i'll report back fail.=============================================================i bought jaybird bluebuds x girlfriend, i've used several times, comparison point.these headphones utilitarian, price conscious design. don't sound awesome $180 bluebuds, aren't sleek (bluebuds cord tiny ear pieces). but, easy control, light, sound good. i'm taking away anything saying don't sound good bluebuds... bluebuds sound good bose klipsch wired models similar cost (even mkbhd says amazing). motorola buds really sound great. i'd choose based sound cheaper wired sets (skull candy, jvc, etc.)the ear pieces, first, worried them. didn't look like would secure, wrong. easily work stay in. swivel bit ear pieces, every time move, don't hear bunch thumping like many in-ear wired sets.and taking hear world around nice, magnets. flopping around.the built-in equalizer settings nice, controls easy, stay around neck laying back.so sacrifice portability bluebuds, get great ease use, good sound, less half price.and truthfully, aren't super stylish... people walking around giant beats studio headphones on. look way less ridiculous that, really aren't bad. don't wear job interview. 
 walk away father next leading one doesn't fade even thru thickest walls 
 ear buds wonderful. let's listen privately anything need still participate daily activities. would highly recommend. 
 comfortable, clear volume great fittting around neck. don't turn aroundyour neck much lg. great 
 lg hbs-730 use bike rides problem. recently, route took lot interference near power lines tower. music lg glitches much can't enjoy music anymore. also plantronics backbeat go 2. one little bit better, music still glitches break area interference. phone samsung galaxy s4 active it's stored bike jersey back pocket, less two feet headset.before try unit, went try lg hbs-750 (one user review said less interference). hbs-750 worst. started break even enter interference area.i finally give one try. wow, don't know kind power use, three rides far haven't experience one single glitch yet. music break up, phone call conversation break up. it's nice finally uninterrupted music.i problem time, receive phone call party side couldn't hear me. don't know it's party headset. party calls back time, press pickup button, headset doesn't respond button push.the sound awesome well. say bass better hbs-730. magnet stronger well. like tuck unit behind shirt using ear plug let dangles, naturally falls attached back magnet unit ... shirt. keep earplug swinging back forth using it. don't know design accident. either way, it's cool. 
 spoiler alert: stupidly long review. like provide much detail possible write review, that&#8217;s sort thing look reviews. buying things online retailers great all, prevents us getting hands-on information we&#8217;ve already shelled money. detailed reviews best way combat disappointment buyers&#8217; remorse. either get popcorn and/or coffee, skip end, skip review entirely &#61514; seriously though, it&#8217;s long review. prepare yourself.this headset close ideal i'm probably ever going get, least headsets implanted subdermally behind ear, music communications beamed directly brain something. great sound, features, fit, looks. downsides i'll get way first, get back gushing thing. first, feel earbud cords maybe .5 .75 inches short. wear mainly i&#8217;m work, underneath collar polo shirt. cords therefor dip edge collar, make trip back ears. it's fine i'm looking straight ahead, turn head much tug 'outside' ear (if look left, tugs right ear vice versa). i've gotten around somewhat removing little silicone o-rings intended manage earbud cords. releases little cord length tugging less noticeable, still there. cords bit short taste even wearing t-shirt, aren&#8217;t bad. next downside headset support connection two devices once. get &#8220;one device time&#8221; thing improves handoff music calls, since easier services provided one phone/device, still wish could listen personal phone's music collection able take calls work phone. headsets like sony mw600 handle ease. clarify buds paired multiple devices, connected one device time. currently, i&#8217;ve got paired android tablet phone, ipod, work iphone. switch one another manually disconnecting one connecting another (via device&#8217;s settings), don&#8217;t go pairing process every time want switch &#8211; pairing buds difficult all, would get annoying real quick.now i've got way, talk stuff like buds, pretty much everything. first off, let assure headset support apt-x bluetooth connections available. apt-x bluetooth audio codec designed provide sound quality equal wired headset. bluetooth audio connections compress audio, making sound somewhat muddled and, well, bad. happens regardless quality source audio file. apt-x support commonly available recent samsung (including galaxy s3, s4, s5) htc phones (including one m8), others well. you&#8217;re interested, ridiculously complete .xlsx spreadsheet available jessebandersen dot com, simple google search also yield results. found jesse&#8217;s page searching &#8220;aptx enabled devices&#8221; &#8211; first result list. sadly apt-x supported apple yet, knowing they'll come proprietary alternative works headsets (they bought beats dre last week so, get ready). almost passed buds apt-x isn't listed anywhere specs reviews saw amazon. go motorola's site look user manual find it. originally going go lg tone headset line (which also supports apt-x), didn't like &#34;flat loop&#34; design &#8211; looks like great fit&#8230; robot. opinion buds designed better fit actual human: front control stalks bend gently down, following curve neck/shoulders/collarbones. majority headset (including small weight battery pack) rests base neck, control stalks rest comfortably near collarbones. lg tone can't time since formed flat circle: stalks aren&#8217;t angled relative neck band, carry weight battery they&#8217;ll fall collarbones center section halfway back neck (the newer ones curved like buds, $70 expensive). i&#8217;m wearing buds headset right now, hardly feel &#8211; great improvement traditional &#8220;earhugger&#8221; bluetooth headsets. i&#8217;m talking fit, probably mention wear 17.5&#8221; collar, can&#8217;t stand things touching neck throat. buds fit quite comfortably, provide slightest reassuring touch front sides neck. widest gap left right control stalks measures hair 5 inches.the buds tidy control arrangement easy navigate. play/pause/answer/end/track-skip commands (as well eq settings voice dial activation) handled rocker switch left, volume adjustments handled rocker switch right. microphone underneath rocker switch left, power switch underneath body (center section) headset, next charging port. play/pause/answer/end done single press forward half left rocker switch, little bit texture identification/grip purposes. activate voice dialing (like siri samsung&#8217;s s-voice google voice search) long-pressing button music playing. track-skip forward done single press back half switch, track-skip back done double press. kind wish skip forward/back handled separate buttons, it&#8217;s easy enough get used to. one thing note mic stalk answer/end button: feel around end call button, person end going hear since microphone right beneath it. lots loud rustling noises. oops. enough list full-on downside, still... kind annoying. could placed mic right, come think whole lot less &#8220;busy&#8221; since mostly volume control functions. volume achieved pressing forward half right rocker switch, volume pressing back half. mute active phonecall pressing portions volume rocker, reject incoming call long-pressing either one volume buttons. eq modes changed long-press &#8220;play/pause&#8221; switch left. 3 eq modes, indication one in, documentation effects supposed be. voice notification &#8220;eq mode changed!&#8221; that&#8217;s it. you&#8217;re figure exactly means. best guess modes flat, treble boost, bass boost. general &#8220;audiophile&#8221; rule, flat eq response best since doesn&#8217;t meddle sound balance hear artist intended. barely tell eq mode bass boost, can&#8217;t tell difference two. can&#8217;t tell difference, guess doesn&#8217;t really matter. i&#8217;d recommend switching modes listening general type music, getting eq setting like, never changing again. obvious pictures literature, earbuds held magnetically ends control stalks use. magnets pretty strong, earbuds yet bounce loose. fact, strong remove earbud ear don&#8217;t attach end stalk, i&#8217;ll eventually find connected point i&#8217;ve moving around. needless say, don&#8217;t get parts close credit cards.as far sound quality goes, i&#8217;m really impressed. earbuds said &#8220;premium hd speakers&#8221;, whatever truly means, sound great apt-x support really helps shine. point buds still sound great non-apt-x devices like apple gadgets, certainly sound good bluetooth headsets don&#8217;t support it. long earbuds seated properly (which critical in-ear earbuds) bass response nice solid, everything sort sparkles. saying &#8220;sparkle&#8221; added way, music fine detail you&#8217;ll hear lot it. speaking earbuds seated properly, documentation talks bit &#8220;micro-adjustability&#8221;, translates stem earbud pivot certain amount around central axis sort narrow cone shape, angle stem relative earbud&#8217;s body change bit fit different peoples&#8217; ear structures. earbuds seem stay fairly well seated unless get really sweaty. speaking sweat, also note buds labelled &#8220;sweat proof&#8221;, make worry little bit. sweat easily, lot biking walking, work somewhat physical too. hopefully become issue. little rubber plug partially remove access charging port, make sure place back securely getting sweaty. anyways, back audio quality: one important thing note, true high quality sound delivery devices, final output depends highly good source material. know low quality sources like 128kbps .mp3 files even tracks pandora streaming services aren&#8217;t best, hear every little bit badness. headsets may mask they&#8217;re also masking fine detail better quality files, way it&#8217;s actually good thing. call quality ends line really good well, i&#8217;ve never anyone ask &#8220;are using bluetooth?&#8221; usually get use headsets. fact, one person stop mid-conversation ask &#8220;didn&#8217;t say going put bluetooth headset?&#8221;, almost didn&#8217;t believe said already had. one last thing audio quality &#8211; listen music via app preamp gain, may want reduce gain level zero. use poweramp galaxy s4 dismayed first hear ton distortion, especially low end. almost returned headset could get rid it. eventually found preamp gain (on poweramp&#8217;s eq settings page) set 75% capacity, turning eliminated distortion completely. get rid distortion 25%, risk it? keep zero sure. also reduced overall volume, since things get plenty loud own, don&#8217;t mind all.usually hate looks bluetooth headsets: obnoxious blinking blue lights giant blobs techno-crud clamped peoples&#8217; ears make look like extras bad 80&#8217;s sci-fi movies. say motorola buds practically disappear, especially wearing collar polo shirt. indicator light, nestled power switch charging port, it&#8217;s visible they&#8217;re worn. say, first wasn&#8217;t pleased fact even black headset white bits (the undersides flat cords, silicone ear pieces, forward/inside halves earbud shells). changed mind much come enjoy subtle high-contrast design. looks nice modern without looking like it&#8217;s trying hard. said, practically disappears polo collar &#8211; see white silicone ear pieces touch white cord. you&#8217;ve got earbud inserted, white flash undersides cords help make little obvious others you&#8217;re either listening music talking phone. say &#8220;a little&#8221; people still give weird looks walk room i&#8217;m mid conversation. make universal &#8220;i&#8217;m lunatic, i&#8217;m phone&#8221; gesture folks, observant ones figure easily. see come blue, makes even sad don&#8217;t come red. see, sickness. sickness yet defined (or even acknowledged) science, overwhelming love (some, like wife, would say &#8220;unhealthy obsession&#8221;) black things red trim, red things black trim, or&#8230; well, get idea. came red, i&#8217;d sell 4 5 pints blood (or least black/white buds) get set. maybe one day.those main points wanted talk about. things don&#8217;t really fit review elsewhere, i&#8217;ll stick here. specs say wireless range 150 feet, &#8220;class 1 bluetooth device&#8221;, phone probably isn&#8217;t. realistic use still around 30 40 feet, minor barriers like walls doors. don&#8217;t even know find true class 1 bluetooth device, get 150ft range spec head. battery life seems pretty good, although try charge headset every night, i&#8217;ve gone far 2 full workdays mixed usage without running battery. they&#8217;re rated &#8220;up 12 hours&#8221; playback, it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess actually means. talked silicone earpieces earlier, forgot mention come 3 sizes &#8211; small, medium, large. buds come small ones installed already, found mediums best me. earpieces earbuds (both wired wireless) 99% interchangeable, slightly different. posts ear stems slightly smaller diameter standard, earpieces sets bit loose. swapping earpieces buds would result sound leakage result poorer sound quality bass response, also put much higher risk one earpieces coming stem sticking ear. trust me, don&#8217;t want that. stick 3 sizes provided find one best suits you. use biggest size stand, good seal critical good sound quality. another thing mentioned briefly buds&#8217; voice notifications. buds set pre-programmed voice notifications built you&#8217;ll hear turn headset off, change eq settings, maybe commands. power up, headset plays short musical tune chipper female voice says &#8220;welcome motorola buds!&#8221; connect phone mp3 player, voice says &#8220;device 1 connected!&#8221; voice isn&#8217;t bad, took get used to. receive phone call, play another tune instead mirroring phone&#8217;s ringtone. think it&#8217;s riff first notes &#8220;ride valkyries&#8221; could wrong. buds also play soft &#8220;bloop&#8221; noise every time play pause adjust volume. &#8220;bloop&#8221; noises, really indication whether unit even powered up. mention headset loses connection automatically power 5 minutes save battery. pick headset don&#8217;t know power state it&#8217;s in, hit volume button listen bloop. headset yet drop bluetooth connection own, first headsets i&#8217;ve owned kind impressive. last thing wanted talk (yeah, made list) thin rubber strips run undersides control stalk, think serve purpose covering track wires run through. small section one strips popped week would seat back down. eventually decided probably held place sort adhesive, since could get &#8220;pop back in&#8221;, placed tiniest dab krazy glue there, wiped excess, held place dried. month ago, popped back yet.so that&#8217;s absolutely every observation motorola buds i&#8217;ve made since got them. you&#8217;ve read that, salute you. probably owe 20 minutes life back. sorry that. summary, promised start:for tl;dr crowd, wholly approve headset. it&#8217;s headset i&#8217;ve waiting quite time for, it&#8217;s finally here. features, fit, sound, looks pretty much perfect, it&#8217;s hard come list serious disadvantages. write this, it&#8217;s available $58, quite steal. nearest competitor lg hbs-800, normally goes $130. check &#8211; don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll disappointed.

 give five stars - despite technical problems:you send receive vcfs e-mail attachments - can't always file receive them. rendered well enough move material manually. varies - long filename ends .vcf mime type text/x-vcard text/directory, otherwise formatted correctly, get taken. but, applications, example, evolution, great linux e-mail application, give something never file meaningless filename, sidekick file evolution's vcards (unless export file resend right mime type).rather picking name vcard import vcard's formatting, sidekick uses filename. might mean would simply pass garbage vcf interface, careful.you get urls sms messages show urls, can't click them. can't click urls aim browser - copy text mail yourself, click urls mail, pulls makes clickable end.the documentation says phone wap browser. might say, "with regular browser, would care wap browser?" - answer bandwidth - want look phone number, wap faster. cool wap games. real answer, according t-mobile tech supervisor wap browser vaporware - work. maybe someday. sites can't browse without javascript working wap analogues (like microsoft's sms generation site). can't browse phone.that it. rest great. moved nextel data exporting data nextel site, and, openoffice, rearranged column names match would exported outlook express, imported. oh, yes, also built names formula. saved comma file, like outlook had, and, poof, minute, couple hundred phone numbers, addresses, names migrated merged appeared phone. could mailed vcfs 70-80 contacts using, didn't work.i've resisted games (i want minesweeper - yes, know lame). might drop $4 solitare.i drop $10 terminal program, already become helpful - terminal program wonderful something tiny device. check servers connecting raw mode, port. ssh, securely, server. lots disconnects, mostly related stop typing think couple minutes, program available linux called "screen" allows save programs running background reconnect them, see output, get status, stuff. even get irc using character mode irc client.someone called fix something weekend - something could fixed 5 minutes real terminal, took eight tiny terminal. many ways, emacs seems work better vi character mode, work.one secret log windows box using ssh character mode using free products cygwin sfu (from microsoft pro). command line only, sorry.to echo comments aim client, utterly reliable vs. yahoo client, drops reconnects time, probably worthwhile.the documentation suggests surf graphics speed. many buttons graphical and, unlike every character graphics browser simply displays alt text, or, none, "[image]", button completely goes away, means can't access button points to. essentially means leave graphics surf.occasionally, web sites mis-represented - ebay, example, extra entry bubble generated search text bubble putton push - enter text (which seems right place) searches don't work.despite niggling problems, t-mobile's hapless tech support, still giving device five stars. astounding thing poker playing dog wags tail good hand, tell good hand all.the difference getting text directions able pull map area drive road wonderful - javascript stops able pull turn turn map need it.i expect something hand would allow log system using ssh, browse all, much less pull mapquest maps.

 3 years working great. battery lasts long. phone durable solid. 
 ok, used motorola t720 (one worst phones made), motorola timeport 8767 (one best phones ever made). needed new phone ventured local verizon wireless store. happen upon lg vx7000 think...this thing huge! don't need camera phone...but pick play around it. it's pretty comfortable hold. screen nice, bright clear. wind purchasing one vzw online phone arrives, put test.this phone far terrific! phone tad larger last t720 much...the main lcd nice bright tft screen. included wallpapers, 3 "real" pics(a sunset scene, island scene, group people scene), verizon logo wallpaper "doodle type" cartoony pics. change settings display easily, ui lg much better old moto. front lcd nice enough...you also set wallpaper use pic taken camera use picture id person calls.ringtones...kinda forgettable (i beginning think cell phone providers tell phone makers make pretty useless ringers download decent ones). however, record sound surprisingly good internal mic, well download verizon's get brew service. also, use mp3's ringtones little trick. one think like...this phone loud!! hear ringing crowded shopping mall even. vibrate feature works well enough activated quickly (though requires flip open phone).the camera located "hinge" flip would rotates snap pic without contorting face arms face lens. also change pic settings like black white sepia tones, etc. camera quite decent vga cell phone camera. flash though rather useless except close pics. camera also lets take 15 sec video clips save email friends. figured i'd never use feature, twice already. advantages camera/video something always carry quite nice...it's fine candid moments though friends might know camera phone, won't probably guess you're video recording them. :dthe call quality nice,loud, clear...much better old cell phone. battery life approx. 5 days light usage charges little 2 hrs. mind you, old "blue versions" phone charging plug near data port...the new "black face" ones charge straight data port.the holster came mine (the black vx7000) great...solid cheapy like phones are. notice face phone flashes colored led's near "flash" receieve call making one...some like don't.i like phone it's size deceptive. tonight showed friend said, "that thing huge!"..then compared panasonic camera phone noticed...hers bigger lol. one verizon's best cell phones right now...highly recommended. 
 guys,i used several friends bluetooth headsets (motorolas jabras) decided didn't want one. found mobile freedom read reviews. know logitech used lot stuff good results tried it. everything read!! it's quiet wind, it's battery lasts days me, it's easy use, easy pair sound quality awesome!! nobody could ever tell using headset. takes bit get used ear clip, problems. may bit heavier larger some, little tiny ones look chic also terrible reviews terrible performance!! try out, won't regret it. 
 bought logitech reading numerous reviews various brands. use device motorola v551 phone (cingular). works geat! charges quickly charger folds compact fashion use (the electrical prongs fold recess charger). unit holds charge long time. left drawer month, pulled still ready go!i use device couple times month business, driving, etc. windscreen outstanding cuts noise even driving window open. people complain ear piece. seems fine adjust easily, keep mind headset annoyance first wear one. becomes second nature.the sound great, phone detects device quickly, fairly comfortable. performs like device twice price, 
 motorola razr phone absolutely hate low hearing volume bad reception resulting missed calls. seriously planning returning/selling got freedom headset!it makes huge difference! lightweight comfortable! problems range battery life. little bulky though. got day must buy, especially $40 $10 rebate = $30!! 
 bluetooth headset i've used, don't anything compare with. made ipaq 6315 much usable phone. sound quality good, people say sound far away, i'm experimenting gain ipaq, we'll see helps. little tight first (big ears), able bend part goes around ear little much better now. great battery life.would nice external ringer it, could hear ringing vibrate away phone. good range 15-30'. 
 let say things:buy device. reasons:- 7-8 hours talk time- true 30 feet range- wind filter clear talking- small comfortable, doesn't intrude ear- crazy price, huge quality- warranty reliability logitech!i've used sony ericsson jabra bt200 would say jabra much better sony ericsson, logitech blows away. it's faster put logitech range much better. microphone clear crisp speaker volume loud sufficient.for me, used jabra a210 bluetooth adapter sprint sanyo 8100 phone w/2.5mm headset jack. gave bt phone could use headset. auto-answer hang depends phone whether would normally headset not. works great me!if considering headset, get one. it's bluetooth technology like. it's great amazon sold out... nice. $39.99 (where go???) 
 bit skeptical saw price read reviews thought hey logitech must good. right headset comfortable compared another headset bought. ear speaker loud even point don't highest setting. mic thing worried though, called friend's cell phone talked pleasantly surprised sound volume clarity. also haven't complaints friends i've talked headset. experience logitech makes best wireless devices buck didn't let one (second logitech wireless devices two month; also bought xbox controller definitely also worth buy.) 
 cheap excellent value. problem uselessness confronted windy conditions- much better job most. v simple instructinos, though lacks ability switch easily headset & phone & back.nevertheless $35 under, brilliant value. 
 spent lot time phone, particular bt headsets. tried every brand bt headset imagine, mean every brand. frustrated point ready go back wired headset ran little guy. far best one, hands down. miserable experence jabra motorola. lot connection audio quality issues brands.bt headset designers seem favor visual appeal rather performance. don't understand headsets market short stubby, microphone right next ear instead month. microphone far away results turn microphone sensitivity, cause headset pick everything including background noise. lack effective noise-filtering system one logitech headset, end wind noise, car noise, ac noise, every kind noise voice. additional, close promixity speak microphone creates feedback loop nice serving constant echoing. lost count occasions friends coworkers end phone tell "get crappy jabra bt headset" "take motorola bt headset". amazed people end easily tell it's jabra bt headset horrid sound quality.onto gem, sound quality amazing, far best bunch. windstop system really work. together farther extending microphone, unit produce best sound incoming outgoing. know many users complaining fit, it's really fault user. one reviewer pointed out, "correct" way wear this, think provides excellent fit comfort.i can't speak all, personally don't wear bt headset fashion statement. use mean convenience safety, sound quality fit top factors consideration. note, clear winner. wish product managers designers motorola particularly jabra take note that. jabra (250 250v models) worst it's behind ear design heavy-trigger button really lousy product terms usability sound quality. sure customers raved jabra would rank unit world!

 could impressed. highly skeptical buying bluetooth headsets like crazy trying find one worked, they're pretty much junk. thing worked way sidewalk, likely much further, that's far went. quality end clear. manual plain stupid, looks like half way putting together released it, mac manual course needed, plug worked without driver install nonsense windows requires. btw, using primarily skype.ok, add something review. there's fatal flaw device. flaw makes device near worthless now. usb cable unplugged, earpiece left clipped holder/charger, battery runs within hours. obviously simple diode somewhere would prevented this, device close useless.update: may 8th 2011. so, 5 years later, device seriously failing. electronics device dying. constantly remove battery get headset work, it's cutting middle calls. also refuses charge, discharges use even base connected via usb. it's pity failing, came looking new version, none. buy again? 
 usb wireless headset. plug mac pc sees another sound device , drivers needed (xp os x) tested skype mac teamspeak pc . comes sound api windows skype others allow buttons phone pickup hangup calls , try like use apps without special add ons ...the range great , skype dont want tied pc plug bad boy free walk house , goes teamspeak gamers there.it pleasing something work box change! tried hours thing using bluetooth mess... thing works! 
 use product skype calls. found high quality (but expensive) wireless headset voip uses. use windows vista windows 7. headset lasts long time (all day) without charging, go computer outside house half way street still clear calls. ear piece comfortable i'd like, wear think head adjusts shape.software install easy, setup pretty no-brainer. functionality adjustments use learn about.i use brand also regular phone headset work phone absolutely love it. i've found high quality calls battery life every plantronics device i've ever used. 
 got treo 650 pre-order day using treo 600 year (and 4 replacements ... 600s kept breaking). dramatic improvement love it.the screen high res looks incredibly clear, bluetooth works wonderfully wireless jabra headset. call comes simply hit answer phone call comes headset. don't particularly like comfort fit jabra ear probably looking alternatives well.the camera actually good enough take snapshots would keep. almost good low end digital cameras. critical buttons placed intuitively.initial setup went pretty smoothly, far, seamlessly upgraded old treo 600 software imported contacts calendar well almost applications. sprint phone rep activated phone actually seemed quite knowledgable.the real con treo 650 hotsync cable connector big clunky compared 600. imho made backward step replacing sleek original treo connector tungsten design connector. requires separate power supply charge. used charging treo 600 single usb hotsync cable laptop. extra power connection messy annoyance. upside since battery removable spare charging elsewhere.overall opinion wouldn't even consider returning buying treo 600 treo 650 available. 
 purchased phone months ago truly say one best investments ever made! doubts comfortable i'd lugging around big phone like this, short lived hands. get much use phone, phone itself, pda capabilites. never organized top things. thing sometimes freezes connects bluetooth, it's minor complaint one easily overlooked look back see much phone helped me.

 nextel user years motorola products including i90, i95, i730 i830. v3 best motorola product ever!!! blows i830 water makes look like yesterdays news. superior striking good looks solidly built - no, look cheap previous reviewer stated. live ga cingular reception good. paired v3 bluetrek g2 bluetooth headset(received rave reviews cheap - pick one ebay) wonder took long get board. fear cingular's merger at&t; since at&t; years ago reception terrible.i'll never go back nextel appreciate customers motorola products bluetooth except blackberry. plus wants carry around brick pocket? i'm woman typically carry v3 purse sometimes convenience want put jean pocket. forget it's there...this v3 superior browser technology, email text messaging, good camera great voice record. yes, address book different get used it. anyways, put important people call frequently address book it's problem me. primarily make lots calls like check news send text messages. a+++++++ 
 sexy form... check. innovative construction... check. exclusive price tag... check. sea flip phones candy bar phones look alike, razr v3 ferrari mobile phones stands such. you're looking feature rich phone, v3 v600 provide features far less. want high-quality constructed phone screams, &#34;look me, i'm sexy b*tch,&#34; v3 alley.actually, better analogy would be: acura nsx mobile phones. like nsx, feel v3 marketing tool motorola. it's way saying, &#34;we're known inexpensive phones, but, look, build stylish, well-crafted, high-end phones too!&#34;unless wireless technology improves gsm, v3 phone definitely keep 2 years. styling, design, construction good (i upgraded trusty reliable, yet mediocre nokia 3360 tdma phone).there's quite debate construction v3 best explanation i've heard bottom backside (below battery cover) lower front plastic antenna. certainly makes perfect sense (unless metal frame antenna) areas cold touch (in weather) areas usually room temperature. furthermore, would misrepresentation motorola's part advertise such. regardless, phone may seem flimsy, it's solid -- comparison w/ old nokia 3360 girlfriend's v551.mikey's likeys:1- mini-usb port. great single-point access data charging -- it's simple mobile phone standard!2- bluetooth connectivity. coming wired hands-free setup, bluetooth headset (a jabra bt250) godsend. leave v3 charging home office still connected living room. (side note: stay away d-link bluetooth usb adapter pc connectivity get belkin f8t001 adapter -- read review d-link details)3- quad band. doubtful i'll ever use feature/benefit, two words certainly impress around you.4- speakerphone. i've non-believer mobile phone speakerphones, i've got admit, v3's speaker phone bomb. it's loud clear (but loud enough car). girlfriend tells sound better w/ v3 speakerphone w/ old nokia 3360 wired headset setup. don't bluetooth headset, i'm spoiled w/ speakerphone.5- internal display. going v3 nokia 3360 leap spacial proportions couple weeks, found spoiled w/ large internal display. that, v3 ati imageon graphics accelerator! phones (excluding pda phones) pale comparison regard.mikey's no-likeys:1- memory expansion. don't see using 5mb internal memory, sd/mmc card expansion slot would nice. maybe motorola (or somebody else -- maybe myself) come w/ mini-usb adapter purpose.2- poorly written owner's manual. found owner's manual like reference manual sometimes leaves figuring things own. explain use many common features owners (especially ones new motorola phones) use. instead, lists features expects put 1 1 together. it's like &#34;c++ reference&#34; vs &#34;learn program c++ 21 days.&#34; maybe motorola's technical writers technical?3- drops dings. like &#34;ferrari,&#34; i'll probably go week-long mourning first time drop ding phone. i'm hoping [good] cases available protect v3 juggles around w/ keys pocket. (side note: heard cingular / lockline insuring phone, cingular sales guy hesitant sell phone unless bought insurance)4- edge. girlfriend's $99 motorola v551 edge. shame, shame, shame motorola. bad motorola. bad, bad, bad. alas, it's akin buying $160k ferrari 360 modena cheap $20 factory stereo system (or paying $90k acura nsx it's 290hp).5- internal display colors. hyped hear 260k colors, motorola's specs detective footwork 65k colors, 260k colors mpeg-4 video playback. very, very, sneaky mis-leading indeed.wishlist:1- wished pocketpc smart phone version phone. pocketpc + v3 form factor = perfection.regarding multiple numbers one name review -- set phonebook display primary numbers by:1- setting primary number names multiple numbers (you don't name one number);2- set address book view &#34;primary contacts&#34; phonebook menu &#62;&#62;&#62; phonebook setup &#62;&#62;&#62; view;3- voila, primary numbers displayed.the way motorola implemented intuitive nokia's implementation (refer owner's manual dis-like above), found motorola's implementation little robust.update: it's nearly three weeks since i've bought phone buyer's remorse. 
 i've phone here's think.the user interface bad rap people, yes, it's intuitive say, nokia's interface, pros. customize every button, including 4 arrows, left right soft keys. left soft key programmed go "shortcuts" every function need right there. course, use, get used interface.the volume phone decent. problems hearing people, problems hearing me. speakerphone works great too. boyfriend says longers feels like he's talking someone tunnel use speakerphone calls. volume problem see highest volume (7), still slightly hard hear phone ring. one thing - phone way cool ringtones.the address book issue this: use sim card store addresses, no, able multiple entries one person. use phone's memory store numbers, many many numbers stored entry. numbers stored powerbook's address book, i'm worried sim card. mac, isync works wonders syncing numbers/calendars razr....now that's cool!the screen large clear. problems seeing dark even bright light. problems reception cingular far. fact, stronger signal places previous phone (nokia 6230)overall, pleased design, functions, asthetics phone. 
 look carefully called "bad reviews" notice either don't know use phone may 1-2 1000 received faulty phone happens every manufacturer, every brand, every type phone.now wife & 12 days far problems whatsoever, ordered 2, got black one got silver one. got free btw.just word like us want "shared plan" cingular amazon offer plans order, ordered 1 phone 1 cheapest single plan each, amazon sends conformation order shipped get "cell phone numbers" right email.i simply called cingular gave phone numbers phone told deal service changed "single 700 rollover mins shared plan" even got phones hands, problems respect. got phones called back check yes person cingular done everything asked, also checked phone go "my account" main menu page phone goes online checks everything account, many minutes, plan, next bill due, etc etc, sure enough everything supposed be.as far signal strength excellent area, go house upstairs downstairs stays 4-5 bars, don't recall seeing less 3 bars around town far, phone gets great signal, cingular "in area" puts great signal.my wife came back business trip, 150 miles away "with roaming charges" btw last cell phone service "alltel" would roaming within 20 miles.anyway got hotel called perfect signal strength, put phone "speaker phone" mode laid phone closed position night stand unpacked suitcases, put mine night stand talked hour problems all, free call "mobile mobile".we sent couple text messages worked problem.she used phone alarm clock next morning worked perfectly.now 1-2 reviewers said battery life, likely gotten one 1-2 1000.i've phone 12 days charged 3 times never let go point says "needs" charging, average 4 days per charge like manual states appears though battery life getting bit better charges, i'm easily going get 3-5 days per charge, that's lot fiddling around it's new 1-2 hours talk time.some one mentioned dropped phone hinge broke. yet drop phone seems well made me, either way would suggest getting krusell cover delivered yet, also insurance $4.99 month cingular covers anything everything life phone, thus problem solved.someone mentioned something "address book slow" even sure means, 8 numbers far comes virtually instantly me, maybe 100++ numbers might take couple seconds? dunno.as searching phone book, mentioned make new entry number person, don't, option show numbers way wish, either "name" "speed dial #" "voice name" even "email" without picture person.someone said took 5-10 seconds open address book dial number it, well 3-4 secs, mention set "voice command" takes 1 sec.want faster easier lot names/entries? set "list only" "no picture" "primary number only", simple. also separate numbers even putting "categories" "business/personal/general/vips"bring category number way even 100s names & #s thins category.when "primary number only" listed need get numbers & email listing name "highlight name use left right navigation button get numbers" simple easy use. find phone book excellent & fast.1-2 mentioned something "ear piece volume low" ear piece volume fine make sure "volume" turned good cell phone ever used, make sure ear right "top edge phone", low volume sound low. someone mentioned take little blue cover, since nothing ear piece volume, 4 speaker holes along top edge phone make sure center ear even holes volume loud phone used.now find phone overall excellent, gets great signal, way enough features me, works well intended purpose "phone" seems well made, nice size, looks great, really nice screen sharp image & colors.i one complaint far......the screen looks outstanding inside indoor lighting, especially dark, well screen outdoors "sunlight" virtually unreadable. one gripe.i come back update anything changes, right free hardly see go wrong phone.update: 4/08/08my wife still phones, neither us even one single problem getting close 3 years everyday use (these phones, cell phone service land line).the slight problem 2 1/2 years finally change battery went cheap $5 battery find several places even close good original battery fault phone.these phones preformed flawlessly use hell them. 
 bought phone editors choice leading computer magazine. would preferred motorola v3 razor still far expensive found phone basically razor thin stylish.plus points phone include:- beautiful screen. large, bright, excellent resolution.- good pictures camera. can't believe .3 megapixels... course won't able blow posters anything like viewing computer even occasional 3x5 print pictures good.- excellent sound quality speaker ringtones speakerphone sound great.- nice construction easy grip rubberized metal trim back.- button layout nice dedicated button taking pictures volume buttons side. also note buttons user programable.- phone also voice dialing picture caller id (although pictures small appear external display)- bluetooth easy set use- true quad band phone used worldwide (although unlocked first).- excellent battery life. can't believe reviews say needs charged every day... find charging phone 4-5 days moderate use. course screen saver turned make sure bluetooth disabled using maybe great stanby talk times. also place purchased phone told charge 24 hours first use (to condition li battery) maybe helped increase battery life.the negative points phone include:- blue external display looks cool think would visible typical backlit black white lcd (like motorola v180)- instruction manual (like motorola manuals) good job explaining features play phone little bit fully make use phone do.- even though pictures camera excellent, video quality good. course cell phone video camera guess would expect. also flash camera (unlike camera phones) low light pictures great.- usb port phone unless want buy motorola cable, way transfer pictures computer (and mp3's phone) via bluetooth. (hint: get bluetooth adapter less $20 bucks don't waste money buying motorola cable. also bluetooth adapter won't need special software transfer pictures mp3... use software bluetooth adapter).- connector charger typical motorola design occasionally jiggle get fit right make sure press button connector removing else damage contacts... may users problems charging phones- phone comes blue look cool motorola phones like v180 razorall best phone owned. user's complain call drops bad signals complaining carrier phone. personally noticed ever since cingular at&t; merger, signal quality call quality declined. cingular rep told temporary able better integrate networks... makes sense problem since switched sim card new cingular sim makes use networks. 
 i've phone four months now, haven't single technical problem mine, even couple typical drops paved surfaces. charge every night; however, i've found bluetooth radio makes significant difference battery life, may spur complaints shorter battery life v400 (no bt capability one). possible turn bt radio don't need accessories connections. charge lasts several days this. really don't feel inconvenienced charging daily leaving bt on, though.in general, phone great screen quality (compared directly friends' v400s), great speakerphone polyphonic ringtone capability, great sound quality ends, great voice dialing performance (very useful headset), i'm entirely satisfied camera, considering cellphone camera.i'll admit interface bit cumbersome first, it's customizable changeable function keys, shortcuts, menu orders. find mine efficient since i've tweaked suit tastes usage.additionally, contrary previous reviews, successfully transferred information (phone book, etc.) media (pictures, ringtones, etc.) phone bluetooth adapter pc, without using cingular's services. trouble getting work initially, found firewall getting way (remember, bluetooth network connection).i suppose one complaint conspicuous absence games (only comes bejeweled demo), end doesn't really bother me. could buy game $4 really wanted one.overall, find phone feature-rich high quality, efficient use customized, rugged average cellphone. 
 owned one three months, started fall apart. $30 best buy. haven't replaced it, $30 *lot*.$10? i'm buying two more. moving 20 mph bicycle, talking someone, problems. far better sound quality 'backup', jabra boom. ear volume adjustable phone, i'm wondering phones reviewers won't let adjust volume?

 pleased first cover ordered samsung galaxy note 2, wife loving one boxwave. loves compartments id, credit card, money. fit good, problems taking pictures talking. likes carrying strap well, case's flexibility. 
 great case note 2. undecided whether use cover belt holster i've always used. wound ordering both, reiko case. work good separately, together. try use both, almost impossible remove note 2 reiko becomes stuck due tight fit. decided use boxwave exclusively dissatisified decision. simply slide note 2 front pocket. no, phone isn't big pants pocket.the pros case makes note 2 look stylish, due rubbery feel, makes phone feel quite stable hand; however, rubbery feel doesn't interfere going pocket. come con boxwave tuxedo suitup case, would due glossiness, shows fingerprints, however, wipe easily.in summary, would definitely order one cases again. 
 received item dec. using since then. wanted make sure liked job. light weight add bulk phone protecting it. well worth money. thinking ordering different colors. :-) 
 favorite tpu case. offers enough protection grip, take easily slip right back on. slip couple cards bills phone case need be. 
 case little thicker old tpu slim case expected really like firmness material used. gaps flimsy rubber this. everyday case now. fit finish great feels good hand. 
 fits well, offers decent protection gives phone good grip good price. would order case again. 
 thing sweet. say far best case tried box wave. slipped snug even harder get off. although impossible get difficult good thing book. case comfortable hand feels right. controls easily accessed everything galaxy note 2 worked fine case it. thing didn't like come holster. like use holsters carry phone belt. well manage find holster one earlier purchases phone fit box wave like glove. one 2 piece rubber hard plastic cases amazon sells $7.00. can't remember name soon update review order case holster combo holster. chance locate name case holster "rhino" brand. ones "black rhino". hated cases holster perfect fit box wave case. 
 bought replace another bought wife year ago great. heavy, stand work way fits like glove. gives grate stability slippery side phone allows one handed function. 
 bought many cases many different cellphones first case compelled write review. far, best case ever had. fits perfectly, you'd think meant second skin phone. fact doesn't add lot bulk, feels like protect well makes much better. case worth double triple price. wish made exact case every phone. would go-to case. please make one htc one! 
 first, i'm huge fan tpu cases; hate silicone ones. there's huge difference, case you, reader, doesn't know. tpu better... light years better!but lot not-so-good tpu cases there; there's anything wrong tpu. rather, it's they're cheaply made, cut precisely accurately... sort thing.this particular case epitome precision cut. it's perfect. every hole centered whatever reveals beneath... camera lens, flash, speaker, mic holes, earphone jack, and, course, stylus. note there's holes power button volume rocker......and that, trust me, way be! many tpu cases make cutouts power button volume rockers, that's huge mistake. you've ever cleaned old-style computer mouse -- know, ones hard rubber ball partially hanging centerhold bottom -- you've ever open one cleaned one, you've seen dark kinda' fuzzy weird stuff must scratch rollers whatnot. stuff body oil, mixed skin cells, mixed dust hair, mixed lint mouse pad, mixed godknows else. gets around virtually anything humans touch......including inside around hardware buttons smartphone! stuff gets there, buttons stick, phones either won't turn off, can't screens awakened properly... or, one common ones people often don't realize caused sticking power button: boot loops!having tpu cover covers power button volume rocker helps eliminate problem. course, there's still electromechanical home key that's uncovered; look youtube find examples phones owners mistakenly believe broken, home keys cause weird behavior; but, fact, that's wrong time home key gotten gunked-up aforementioned body oil, mixed dust hair, mixed with... well... get picture.there's lot home key problem (if it's hardware electromechanical one, opposed simple capacitive glass), sure keep crap power buttons volume rockers tpu cases cover them......and one does... magnificently. even nicely-molded buttons (as opposed cheap tpu cases sort bulge little bit texture added it. case simply molded beautifully!this case special another reason, too, many people, i'll bet, don't know about, that's precisely sides wrap onto front face phone: bezel around glass screen. it's really nice, different tpu cases it.remember note ii kinda' unique very, edges glass screen aren't like almost phone. phones perfectly flat piece glass screens; there's metal bezel case almost comes contact glass's edge all-'round; top bezel ever-so-slightly elevated flat plane glass screen, place phone glass screen table, glass, itself, actually touching table bezel edge holding millimeter table's surface.well, note ii's glass actually higher (when it's lying back) bezel edge case; and, fact, very, edge note ii's glass seesm roll toward case's bezel. such, lay note ii face (on glass, it's glass actually touches table. makes bit nightmarishness regard screen protectors; one maker (realook) manufactures two dry-apply versions note ii: one sits flat part note ii's screen, leaves wider-than-normal amount uncovered glass edge screen protector actual glass edge; make another (the realook "3d" screen protector note ii) that's molded actually wrap rounded edge note ii's glass, "hang" it, speak, make protector's edge come closer case's bezel, causing completely cover glass rounded edge.with tpu cases, tpu sides wrap onto face glass; totally flat screen protectors leave half millimeter screen protector edge bezel, that's fine. tpu case actually ends-up covering edge make look like screen protector covering entire glass. realook "3d" style screen protector wraps edge, kind -- common kind -- tpu case cause edges corners 3d screen protector curl pull up.this boxwave tuxedo suitup case magnificently shaped edge around glass protrudes higher plane glass, phone laid face (on glass sreen), glass doesn't touch it's held millimeter table desk. gets better: edge "respects" rounded edge note ii's glass, doesn't try wrap onto cover it. therefore, realook 3d screen protector's edges corners remain intact look beautiful.this special tpu case... different others... kind have, actually, use either wet- dry-apply screen protector whose edges go either way to, edge of, note ii's glass.seriously, thing precision... someone really took moment figure best cover unusual note ii... got perfect!the thing wish matte finish back wouldn't show fingerprints. tpu cases called "s-style" "s-series" tpu cases matte finish one side "s" shape case's back, shiny finish (like case everywhere) side "s" shape case's back. entire back boxwave tuxedo suitup kind matte finish that's "s" cases, opinion; least option get either way.sadly, "s" series style cases type whose side wrap way onto touching glass, note ii, doesn't work well screen protectors. plus, many "s" style series cases uncovered power volume rocker buttons. also leave much phone uncovered around camera flash... none problems boxwave tuxedo suitup; me, least, it's worth endure shiny, fingerprint-showing surface.great case! best-of-breed, least among cases don't cause edges corners screen protectors curl-up pull-up. one using "3d" type screen protector realook, though; one using realook's screen protector attaches flat part note ii's screen, tpu cases note ii would fine (as long cover power volume rocker buttons); thing made nicely one. seriously, one made very, well... precise. love it!gregg l. deselmsnapa, california usagregg greggdeselms dot com 
 nice, looks good & durable quality & price wise well. really works described...for samsung note 2. buy accessories online now...more way cheaper & find difference what's store expensive. 
 needs excellent price. fits well, seems rigid enough prevent damage, kickstand nice touch. don't know well kickstand hold time, works well. ridge around front allows put phone face without touching table. case pretty compact still fits smart dock, although prevents hdmi registering. charges goes dock mode, doesn't seem sit far enough engage hdmi. 
 bought daughter phone loves it. solid case easily cleaned soap water. 
 little thick protects well kickstand stronger cases i've tried.the thicker corners also make harder slide car dock. 
 boxwave case bought note ii (bodysuit) disappeared amazon. case uniform glossy texture. boxwave case note great. new case even better. thinner streamlined, buttons work even better. doesn't cutouts buttons, instead well-designed buttons molded case push phone's buttons. like buttons work well protected time crud/damage. cutouts ports/mics/camera/stylus placed perfectly sized appropriately. lastly, case made tpu, best case material opinion. it's firmer stays phone better soft silicone cases pick lint stick pocket, still offering cushion drop it. 
 fits perfect, nice clean look, going buy another one leave inside car case. 
 cover nice, looks expensive. well built, built last. recommend cover. get 
 i've bought several hard cases note2 one favorite. it's easy put take (once figure out). don't drop phone usually can't say drop covers back sides. it's one piece hard case really like.

 update: 18 march 2014after case week, absolutely love it! hasn't broken, however broken nicely comfortable use. cards held securely pocket deep enough bills folded half. plus, stylish. received several compliments questions regarding get own. complaint access volume buttons restricted (i use skipping music tracks i'm driving don't turn screen on).original: 11 march 2014i've case phone couple hours, thought would give update works. put phone case, came almost immediately. solution: take back cover phone put case. holds much securely don't worry it. case seems well made thicker hoped, hopefully protect phone well. one thing worried thin plastic holds phone case. i'll give update breaks chips like many reviewers, then, great case. 
 given half price twelve south's bookbook case iphone 5, expected get cheap imitation here.i think it's fair say twelve south imitation, it's close copy iphone 4/4s bookbook style case, iphone 5 bookbook case. (the new twelve south iphone 5 bookbook case clip secure iphone 5, rather sliding phone leather holster securing tab top.) personally, loved twelve-south's bookbook case iphone 4/4s, didn't like new twelve-south bookbook case iphone 5 returned mine - looked cheaply made, extremely tight, awkward fit getting phone clip case large remnants glue coming over-sized piece plastic decided stick (rather enormous) hole cut camera. product better quality twelve south product. certainly looks feels like real leather, although suspect may (based smell). turns imitation leather, would bonus me, i'm mostly vegetarian anyway :-) price twelve south bookbook case iphone 5, would still prefer boxwave case. 
 great case samsung galaxy s3 boxwave great job making quality classy durable product. love incorporates wallet phone together instead carry separate. provides access buttons, camera, charge slots, speakers makes look obvious closed. many people often mistake journal, calendar, bible, etc. also like protects screen closed position. great product. 
 want basically eliminate issues holding device secure way maintaining total coolness it?this may looking for. seems actual leather unlike many similar cases claim leather actually plastic. wear skinny jeans tend keep phone shoved pocket, you. carry elsewhere concerned combining phone essential bits wallet, really really nice. tend travel car wind carrying phone wallet places eat. allows get three basic things wallet eliminate need carry two restaurant.it makes holding onto phone less complicated factor googol. particularly landscape.the material (seems leather) impregnated serious amount oil close lid, leaves mark face phone. simple solution get paper index card, fold red line top shove little folded bit slot behind cards. &#34;old way&#34; fall back need actually write anything )or someone write something you(, add perfect layer weightless scratch proof protection ever fragile nexus 4 screen.for less might pay 'official' bumper....no brainer. 
 case great quality nice grey color. one day long term review yet. 
 i've previously owned multitude headsets, let tell missing bought jabra.i always thought "in ear" bud bulky-looking design would uncomfortable, not. frankly comfortable headset ever worn, i've worn dozens. truly forget head.as sound quality, everything hear clear, ample volume available. people speak report equally clear sound without much, background noise.battery life great range sufficient put smartphone cradle walk around house office without signal loss crackling.something else liked belt clip. many headsets overlook fact nowhere put earpiece you're using it. belt clip small, big enough actually hold headset, tucks right behind clip phone.if you're clip-loving person, whole headset almost flat profile fits nicely pocket. headsets, especially flip-out mics feel awfully bulbous pocket.one last little "gee whiz" feature- vibro-alert. since want phone charge/sync cradle whenever possible, feature really excites me. instead required actually wear headset times avoid missing call phone room, headset vibrate feature notify incoming call. call "gee whiz" feature never knew needed it!in summary, awful lot headsets there. designs features confusing, rest assured knowing headset everything need (and things may not!) reasonable price. 
 trying motorola hs 810 would feel like always falling falling off, tried several bluetooth headsets sprint cingular stores. jabra, same, loop hook onto ear, fit.this one headset would properly wrap around ear ear piece goes ear canal, stay anchored. sound quality great. hs 810 would hold charge long. far good jabra --- holds charge motorola needed charged time.i like vibrating feature phone ringer turned --- need share noise. call expecting calls often dinner, really makes discreet rather missing call playing telephone tag awhile.sound quality better motorola hs 810. jabra seems work well small ears ear cells make adjustable.if don't need vibrating feature, try new jabra bt 500 upgrade jabra bt 250, charging usb cable great take another charger trip!i also jabra sp500 wireless speakerphone works great vs. motorola speakerphone returned. speakerphone power power ac cords bt 250v compatible, need use both, need two charges, although small. 
 best bluetooth device i've tried. lightweight, comfortable, easy set-up, good sound clarity well made sturdy device. aren't flimsy parts break.the best thing ear peace fairly inconspicuous sits ear. really don't want look like janet jackson control video walk around town mall.the problem finding replacement ear gels. available jabra site site. ended back cingular (now & t) gave couple drawer. 
 replaced 250 3 times verizon store asked given 250v instead 4th 250, far good, think jabra knew 250 defects , 250 died (stopped pairing) 2 months, 250v seems problems works much better motorola v710.the fit great, sound good, could use better noise cancellation, oh well, maybe future model. overall , like 250v. recommend anyone. roll windows driving, wont heard end call. 
 several these. also lots bluetooth headsets. times live wired headset (which time) use one. sit crowded restaurant person talking thinks alone quiet office.brilliant design every phone maker license build handsets.it two microphones, one facing mouth one facing out. cross-connected sound comes sides cancelled. sound coming mouth picked up.stays ear without loop, seals ear canal well actually turn volume.the earpiece shure e2c consumer-grade in-ear monitor (which also own). essentially getting 1/2 $100+ in-ear monitor phone. means excellent sound quality. combined best noise cancelling i've ever used, say best kept secret telephony.i use cell phone land-line phones. one ever knows kind phone i'm on.highly recommended... 
 i've unit year, acts ear plug ear i'm wearing on, hear caller even strong winds. audio quality great. since microphone sits directly front mouth caller hear fine many times don't know car. since it's wired unit, batteries charge it's always ready go. don't mind things ear great head set.update: moved i-phone palm phone. get 2.5mm adapter 3.5, phone see headset time won't route calls it. blackberry curve. hope sure make new model phones, miss using it. 
 shure's quietspot headset best headset market, period. problem shure's coyness works microphone placement *absolutely crucial* using it. understand that, understand everything need order want want anyone else's.the "problem" quietspot--mentioned reviewers here--is failure engineering quality control, one emphasis documentation. barring actual defective unit (which usually work all) nothing wrong quietspot proper adjustment doesn't totally eliminate. believe shure doesn't tell fear alienating technically unsophisticated customers. since nothing sell you, blissfully unconcerned boring write something useful. please note write basis close examination working quietspot educated layman's knowledge.observation tells that, shure's quietspot headset uses active noise cancellation cellular headset market does. means mouthpiece headset uses two microphones: one takes sound world around second takes sound mouth.using trick wiring, dual-microphone arrangement uses sound outside world uses weaken sound microphone closer mouth. since microphones take surrounding sound, strongest sound *isn't* cancelled voice.for work, microphones need good alignment mouth. quietspot demands 'mouth-side' microphone pointed directly mouth, 'world side' microphone pointed directly outwards without mis-alignments like microphone-housing far two far side mouth, microphone housing turned side.the tough part boom holds microphone twist bend quietspot pocket case, turning microphone head around onto side. microphone-head turned it's side, set far mouth, microphones pick voice equal intensity arrangement exactly it's supposed to: treats *your voice* like background-noise sends everything say oblivion.the solution easy useful: learn put quietspot's microphone right place every time put on. learn windscreen on, close perfect headset. used quietspot, standing bars new york city jukebox blasting raise voice far ordinary conversational volume quietspot's noise-blocking earpiece, could hear listener perfectly. two-way noise elimination well-adjusted quietspot amazing, providing sense intimacy privacy conversations headset ever gave including one two cost more.the thing need know quietspot particularly sensitive wind=noise unless intent never use outside, best keep windscreen permanently attached unit. needle thread foam, thin-strand wire. you've done this, you'll learn make important adjustment touch even then, it's still easy.now know this, give quietspot try. won't disappointed. 
 research years ago purchased amazon. it's best headset years. followed 2.5mm cell phones 3.5mm cell phones adapter. sadly, parties longer hear it. even tried new 2.5 3.5mm adapter luck. i'm looking new headset there's nothing like one. shure right wish still made it. everyone likes bluetooth it's hard hear heard. can't believe there's nothing like market anymore. jabra bad reviews tried plantronics one returned it. i'm mourning loss headset wish it'd magically work again. 
 drive convertible gone 6 different hands-free devices didn't work. wind noise awfully high top down, wife could never hear talked hands-free. longer problem. shure works great! comfortable, clear sounding best - i'm audible speak. "turbo" button, would perfect, - terrific. best i've seen... 
 stunned. 2 plantronics (a 320 330) tired earhooks came loose dropped calls. thought provider calls got dropped consistently areas drive to/from work. headset phenomenal! maybe one dropped call week... off/on operation great! open/close boom turn off/on! love headset... don't say often 
 animal fantastic. fool using headset wire. every time turned head ear piece would fall out. turn head still feeling thing waiting strangle me.i reluctantly went motorola hs850 bluetooth headset find life could without wire. initially charge it. phone rest me; located headset immediately started use it. set one ring tome alert answers. virtually background noise say "hello". voice comes clear loud enough use noisy areas. however tell caller hold go appropriate location foot. want accused rude talking self. car warning gives time turn radio caller detect mobile. try make care calls curt call back static location. mobile commuters get offended hand ear change lanes signaling.i keep phone belt never pull out. seldom make out-going calls however phone headset designed make voice dialing instructions still pull phone out. home leave phone book case across room headset still works well. feel like recluse fold headset turned off. 
 one better bt headsets own. hear end heard clearly other. talk time great standby time great. let wife borrow see liked it, needless say ordered another one myself. moto keeps getting better. 
 i'm bluetooth techie, can't compare headsets, month ownership, say works great.my car built-in bluetooth, everbody tells i'm car sounds like i'm water. motorola - i'm told it's crystal-clear.the negatives are:* multifunction button tactile feel - leads press hard, often. especially problem you're walking driving.* flip mic nifty, headset tends wobble shake head all. 
 siemens sx66 (yes, pda-phone supposedly works bluetooth headset there), i'm happy headset.it's reasonably comfortable, great sound volume, even noisy environments, people say sound clear even automobile driving, synchronized right away sx66.most importantly, boom mic flip, turn unit fraction second. sx66 recognizes hs850 headset within second (i'm latest bluetooth v1.1 driver siemens/microsoft - tried applying patch siemens' website, phone already latest version).in short, everything works well, ambient noise cancellation features seem work well, according people i'm talking to.i haven't run point completely lost power - don't know long lasts. least 3-4 days idle 4-5 hours talk time. 
 one lucky get one free registering motorola mpx-220. skeptical whole bluetooth scene, headset quickly changed mind.the device easily last 3-4 days standby mode average usage. sound excellent, people listen think i'm talking normal phone. range great. 50 feet away without problem.the best part phone intuitive on/off. microphone boom "folded" out, turns on. fold back in, turns off. simple, yes. many headsets require push buttons (or hold down). makes using snap!i actually one home office another leave car. 
 bought product weeks back. works really great samsung t609. bluetooth enabled phone, everything else works smooth. good voice quality. 1 small glitch - found use bluetooth, uses battery power cell phone. 
 happy headset. use motorola razr v3.my last bluetooth headset jabra, broke months -- power button quit working, always battery drained.i love hs850 since power button! instead, flip open closed. gets great battery life, since it's easy put standby flipping closed.i also used headset successfully skype windows mac. catch active one device time, disconnect/release cell phone, successfully use windows mac. makes switching back forth pc phone bit cumbersome. course, took couple hours get working windows, worked first try mac ;-) 
 imho slightly better moto h700. it's larger, bit heavier. boom larger. that's issue, equal imho. cheek problem!now problem people cannot hear you, sound muffled away phone. wearing bluetooth, look mirror see boom touches cheek beard it'll touch that. note small hole inside boom gets sound. anything touches impede voice....it's like putting towel regular phone talking someone. need puffy cheeks problem happen. unless narrow face, chances happen you'll blame bluetooth!to fix this, get either neoprene tubing sticky foam one end (mole skin) cut small piece put hinge near boom smaller piece (if needed) top other. make space cheek boom people hear you! fix, still able close boom. 
 wired motorola razr headset better bluetooth one reasons:-the mic closer mouth voice sound better clearer bluetooth headset mic way ear. tried wireless bluetooth headset voice always sounded distant callers could hear ambient room noise around me. said sounded like using speakerphone. use wired headset, say voice quite clear loud.-it's easier plug wired headset time fool around settings syncing bluetooth want headset.-this headset easier carry bluetooth one ac adapater charger battery required.-this headset cheaper bluetooth headset fact comes bundled razr phones.the reason i'm rating headset 5 stars agree reviews, earpiece doesn't fit snuggly ear. minor complaint though headset pretty much want nicely. 
 perfect slim close fitting case well worth money. razr remains thin since case wellcrafted. bulk extremely stylish. krusell makes best cell phone cases world. 
 fits motorola razr v3 like specifically designed it. elastic top allows use flip functionality phone unlike leather covers prohibit phone closing way.perfect. 
 protects phoneit doesn't really make phone thickthe multi-adapter system really works (although usually leave off)the cover snap (literally) install/remove high qualitythe motorola cover pretty bad (see reviews) 
 actually quad-band mobile phone makes true 'world phone'... common tri-band devices.world phones generally equipped w/ 1900 1800 frequencies. together, frequencies cover europe, much u.s. many countries. tri-band units, however, usually equipped either 850 900mhz.850 fills 'rural gaps' states. 900 allows roaming new zealand australia. whereas t-mobile cingular operate gsm frequencies therefore offer world phones, cingular operates 850 t-mobile 900. allow use frequencies instances don't provide needed frequency... provided device equipped w/ 850 & 900 mhz motorola v330.how t-mobile? truth matter (as mobile phone service) comes region live well building area building in. sorry, across-the-board answer. soon one gets great reception, his/her neighbor curses it.visually, phone indistinguishable another flip phone, offers rather large well-spaced keys. screen vivid bright. ringtone gets plenty loud. reasons, it's great phone seniors still want modern phone. got one mum.of course, quad-band, video, camera, multi-zoom, bluetooth, infrared device w/ browser, general ease operation easy. 'said,' many senior probably couldn't bothered w/ messing putting test call quality rural u.s. new zealand.that get price makes v330 eyebrow-raising steal.one thing - it's blue, de riguer black silver, like.a quality phone packed w/ host goodies. go 'head on, motorola. 
 one nicest phones used. traditional flip phone use phone phone works well. 
 itching treo ever since 600 came noticed streamlined design. smartphones first introduced, bucked trend combining two thinking often use cell phone pda, bought one integrated would wear twice fast. humble opinion, valid reason back then, original phone/pda's impossibly large. well finally become convert.i spent great deal time researching blackberry's vs. treo's vs. pocket pc's came close grabbing t-mobile dash (which still believe all-around smallest model availabe write this, least seemed be), finally settled trusted palm os platform (one become familiar years using pda's quite time now). set get one, really heart set treo 680...but read reviews them, one thing kept creeping almost reviews: battery life terrible. aside, quite reviewers mentioned things considered, happy old 650. saw many reviews began think twice. noticed 700p beefed version 650, began consider well. unfortunately write this, isn't available alltell service (it will, nobody give target date, dang it, impatient wait...) right back 650. took palm able knock enough bugs 650 felt like buying one would worth it...and discovering bugs associated 680 & 700p, matter much time spend considering upgrading newer model, find compelling reasons go right back old school 650.reason #1 go it: since longer available palm's official website, newer models coming out, chances find pretty sweet deals older 650.reason #2: virtually problems originally associated 650 eliminated. want push email? get it. want web surfing? prob. want view edit ms word documents excell? easier ever 650 (that one major plus pocket pc's blackberrys -- sure view documents, cannot edit them, too).reason #3: matter convenient pda, found next impossible give touch-screen's amazing versatility ease use edit things connect websites.one important item factor considering buying 650: popularity ever increasing wireless downloading speeds, afraid slower treo would make internet surfing next impossible archaic speeds forced endure. pleastantly surprised downloading web pages take long first expecting. tell you, experimenting supposedly much faster 700p another online carrier one using (i won't say which, really best tell 650 slower dial-up modem 1985), anyway, 650 slightly slower screaming fast 700p 700w. figured something could live honest. hey, it's tiny hand-held device allows send receive email surf web...i'm still amazed something like exists honest you...so downloading speed still secondary opinion. speed really list absolutes, maybe ought move something else...but keep mind, barely faster experienced first hand.one thing: screen amazing. many ways say wow. considering buying palm runs windows mobile, ought know screen clarity almost reduced half. apparently something window's os, seriously put decision buy one back burner.sure things smartphone cannot yet without difficulty impossibility...but current models. serious research want vs. need make informed decision chance go store test specific model personally. matter decide on, likely happy. far, know satisfied choice. good luck yours.***update***i opted get bluetooth hands-free device -- first. originally would see people walking around lt. uhura type thingy's sticking ears couldn't help wonder lazy people cannot raise hand head walking around simply talk phone. part still feel way, decided buy bluetooth hands-free headset driving. cannot afford miss calls, radio, work home found car monitoring radio virtually 100% time unfortunately means sometimes cannot hear ringer. tethered device came phone certainly loud enough, simply fit ear (it kept falling out). bought replacement came variable size adapter yet fit better, sound almost impossible hear (the worst ever experienced, actually). took plunge knowing full-well palm treo somewhat problematic history using devices...so made sure iron-clad return policy place jumped in. took minute configure head-set went ahead made test call enough volume -- fact plenty spare. satisfied performance. (i bought keycera bluetooth, means anything)one additional item requires mentioning: currently call-waiting service treo yet missed least 3 calls (that know of). particular feature seem supported 650...and is, yet discover useful info regarding problem, whether online bible-sized instruction manual. keep looking find solution quickly report asap. one thing think about. otherwise, amazingly satisfied treo otherwise. thing wish (other user-friendly call-waiting) faster downloads online. supposedly possible newer models using evdo yet 700p tested failed work slightly faster 650. maybe network -- according (no surprise there). still think purchase well worth it. 
 it's two weeks treo 650 remember love palm os much. switched blackberry two years ago (7290) i've enjoyed using except very, basic screen. assume that's get remarkable battery life. but, i've switch bb work reasons i'm happily using palm again. last palm palm vx it's still alive kicking many, many years.the treo 650's screen really amazing. and, i've read older reviews treo 650 frequent resetting issue. certainly concerned ready send back problems (cingular gives 30 days try out). far one reset two weeks palm - honestly, reset blackberry constantly i'm sure i'd notice difference. and, bb resets particularly annoying would happen start answering incoming calls literally take 5-8 minutes reset let use again. i'm sure took long - big address book. palm reset took 30 seconds.but, here's treo shines: screen graphics, photos, mp3s videos. put 2-4 movies 2gb sd card, pop palm carry around convenient entertainment. one little feature really impressed ability display screen vertically (it's longer way). letterbox movies really increases size video exceeds size videos zen vision 30gb screen. and, videos really look incredible.and, course, there's ton free software palm. far, i've downloaded tcpmp movies. included realplayer impressive - you're ready listen mp3s right box.final note: i've used palm desktop pim stuff (contacts, calendar, do's) years i'm still impressed it's features easy/quick navigation. they've always ahead pack - know many newer phones come similar pim software pc talk new phone aside blackberry one else even ballpark.you manage photos well even add photos address book you've synced incoming calls display picture caller. know around wasn't available old palm v new blackberry i've using past years. 
 someone used original palm pilot eventually handspring visor visor phone, thought buying treo 650. mixed, sometimes extreme, reviews 650 relatively high price unlocked treo kept away. release next generation treos drmatically forcing price 650 decided take chance. week fairly active use say extremely pleased new treo. bought new unlocked (cingular branded) treo online. phone clarity good mobile phone owned. dropped calls. browswer e-mail client came loaded treo work well. live country fastest mobile data connection still gprs/edge, tro 650 right. easily synced treo macbook problems. $225 + shipping handling $20 say real bargain. 
 love phone!first off, palm functionality wonderful! address book calendar work excellently, cross-functions greatimprovements include sms messaging, much faster includes hyperlinks phone numbers web addresses, unlike treo 600the web faster ---- screen crisperhowever, bluetooth best new feature ----- wireless data transfer is, usually, quick, wireless headphones greatlastly - many complained phone slow functions unstable --- however, ever since system software updated 1.12, made phone much quicker much stable!ordering new phone today come 1.12 software built it, alreadyi former treo 300 600 user, 650 wonderful upgrade worth every penny, considering bluetooth software improvementsalso - you're going gsm, unlocked model great idea, model work gsm network world, depending sim card useso buy it!!! - won't sorryps - cardo scala bluetooth earpiece best earpiece phone 
 send whole credit card sized piece plastic this. it's like christmas kids want play box. yeah, somehow it's exactly like that. 
 much easier buy amazon go store deal sales person. amazon rock. 
 exciting stuff... wooo hooo. plug new 3g sim card new blackberry bold yes works. :) 
 years, household tried multiple bluetooth solutions hands-free communications needs. we've acceptable results solution integrated gps...but much regular driving doesn't include need load full-size gps. we've acceptable results visor-mounted bluetooth speaker unit, let's face it: sometimes want hold conversations don't include everybody car:-)the plantronics voyager 510 proven value overs three years demanding use. fits comfortably ear excellent incoming outgoing audio clarity. best outstanding ability hold charge long time. generally count week charges, even periods heavy use.we liked enough buy three...one driver house. 
 usually don't time write reviews time decided simply help others like tried many different headsets motorola thought probably nothing good market yet. received one gift friend love two simple reasons:1) sound quality excellent. despite fact noisy car drive highway, still hear excellent. actually reduce volume headset volume potential need. tried two headsets motorola past, including hs850. also volume button even set maximum volume can't hear well noisy environment. plantronics provide great quality enough volume noisy environment. also, everyone talked to, told hear well, like speak without headset.2) reason number two - sits perfectly ear. easy insert drive, in, stays there. doesn't move all. unlike motorola headset, fall moves ear takes long time get used fact falling ear. plantronics also provides three different sizes pieces insert ear, makes perfect fit size shape.that say. good headset there. don't need wait more. 
 complaints headset. it's comfortable ear, mute function works flawlessly ps3 krazr! 
 tried everything moto-850 plantronics seeing gold box deal thought heck. amazement really fantastic headset. easy pair, easy adjust volume, great battery life, clear even wind noise city sounds around, last least indicator light look like emergency strobe (i hated mot-850 night would reflect glass dash car side window drive insane...)all 5 star unit 
 owned several bluetooth cell phone headsets, plt 510 best far. fits ear perfectly, wear hours without noticing it, gives great sound. problem syncing iphone, although haven't tried devices, anticipate problems.i two complaints:1. on-off switch small hard use. find push thumbnail make work. smaller fingers, may less problem.2. plantronics uses proprietary connector charging, manufacturers switching mini micro usb. proprietary charging interface means one wire carry me.in summary, great purchase. 
 good bluetooth headset, however recently purchased newer plantronics sound quality smartphone compatibility changed since bought one. still use one cellphones lasted 3 years now. 
 using low-end jabra bluetooth past year, plantronics voyager welcome! paired easily phone different ear cushions, one custom ear canal.while found fit easily onto ear hold well, boyfriend ears flat head hard time hooking ear stay without much adjustment needed. also, said bulky liking, like fine!the sound quality great, hear others well i'm told come clearly. almost 2 months charge besides first time use everyday 1-2 hours time - that's good battery life! 
 works well comfortable, vs couple mot headsets bought, horible. volume level good me, hearing loss, that's impressive well. contols easy use. i'm using older mot v330. highly recommended performance price. oh, contrary another reviewers suggestion, fit mint tin due it's width. haven't found good hard-case solution yet.update 8/16/08:i thought lost 510, reviewing newer units, bought another one! newer models appear riddled minor bugs & issues, stick winner? i'm using t-mobile dash works great voice command features. office trying decide model go with, ordered half dozen latest models headsets. added evaluation pool. two weeks testing, almost everyone liked 510 better rest, ordered 20 them! model discontinued needed new headset, i'd go latest "jawbone"; worked fine, better wind resistance, didn't quite all-day comfort inherent design durability 510. hope helps! 
 really love product. easy use comfortable ear. forget sometime.the quality sound good, clearly hear person talking to. seems hear well.but like price. affordable quality. satisfied headset.thank you! 
 owned 510 almost four years worn nearly eight hours every day. satisfied. cons ear piece block wind background noise well. ear buds getting loose four years, ordering another set those. also ordered new pro plus headset watching product demo wind tunnel. convincing. rate new headset try out. rate, can't go wrong 510. 
 outstanding quality. second plantronics headset i've owned. wonderful. little foam boots sell reduce wind noise don't work. wear mine everyday almost day. comfortable light weight. 
 i've tried motorola ones either couldn't hear person end couldn't hear (usually both). bought based recommendation realtor swore it, honest, occasional trouble it. it's comfortable wear, it's easy hear, person hears me. wear day, project sites, driving, even home. works expected i'm pleased results. need bluetooth, one. 
 tested many bluetooth headsets. one sets bar pretty high. battery life wonderful usually outlasting phone charge factor two. generally compatible regular phones. palm os phone, pick different headset may work, issues find difficult live with.the good: durable headset (mine went washer dryer still works dried days). multiple options ear pieces, flexibility design (switching ears without carrying extra accessories), compatibility lots phones, antenna design solving cross body communications phones, charging options usb power (you wear charging comfortably), battery life great. connects 2 devices time though obviously answer one time.the bad: (all minor) wind smart work great. yet find bluetooth headset handle direct wind noise exception. better remote parties still complain. every headset tested fails here. difficult distinguish mute headset power off. tuned times accident trying mute. oops. mute also alert frequently enough on, still mute phone separately without issues. pairing simple, one button option.i would suggest headset users looking good headset devices. consider options palm os phones. 
 great wind noise reducing headset. works well condition. light weight even though appears bigger units. comfortable fitting headset i've ever used. one negative thing say would sometimes people tell need speak using device rare could possibly device itself. 
 please product also cost got at. 
 great sound, great transmission. lightweight, comfortable. maybe easiest get curls around ear...or i'm challenged. however, mounted, it's pretty secure!linking lg 8300 cell phone breeze. 
 bought unit converts desk phone bluetooth compatible headset - best buy money! talk phone day office, use desk line cell phone. system allows use headset both. good battery life. 
 is, far, best bluetooth headset ever owned. i've tried motorola ones, pale comparison plantronics. see positive reviews thing amazing. walk house phone one spot, talk without interference. problem always forget put phone! range headset truly amazing.the sound quality amazing well. one ever tell i'm headset. start using this, you'll soon wonder ever lived without it. can't tolerate holding phone ear anymore headset makes life much easier.and i've mine two years without problems. accidentally forgot left sweatshirt pocket washed it, still works! couldn't believe it. sure, battery life suffers years use, they're cheap it's problem get new one.my complaint blue light extraordinarily bright. can't charge thing night without covering it's like blue lighthouse room. it's on, flashing blue light annoying dark rooms (e.g. watching movie). that's really complaint.you really cannot go wrong bluetooth headset little money. don't even think twice! i've recommended heaset 10 different people, love it. 
 little ugly-ish set still ruling market great sound quality owners people talk to. owned tested several supposedly great bluetooth sets several different phones devices including iphone 3g, motorola razr l6, blackberry 7100i, two different laptops (skype) playstation 3, headset performed well plantronics voyager 510.in parallel device three different jabras including bt250, bt500 jx10 neither one comes close sound quality wind tolerance voyager 510. also learned number users including boss switched jawbone 1 2 discovery 925 set due fit, comfort sound issues, never even bothered buy jawbone. plantronics voyager 510, people talk can't even tell i'm using bluetooth headset; even i'm driving, find amazing. since it's four years never ending quest perfect bluetooth headset constantly keep researching reverting little "mule", give five stars spite mainly cosmetic flaws.here's got appreciate somewhat clumsy set much:1. good output volume quality. i'm using plantronics voyager 510, people i'm talking can't tell i'm cell phone bluetooth headset - even i'm driving (windows closed). case opposite using jabras, used hear complaints noise, static low volume voice.2. good controllable earphone volume. reasonably well deal traffic noise i'm walking outside downtown chicago office. set volume really loud, case cannot hear partner i'm walking close moving train. usual volume setting around 1/3.3. set's microphone tolerates wind better jabras mentioned used produce great deal wind noise whenever encountering breeze. addition, know i'll outside windy environment put included microphone sponge on.4. good battery life. don't charge often.5. although seems light gentle hands, handles everyday folding switching shirt pocket ears well.6. problems long usage, unlike jabra bt250, used irritate skin back ear used long often.i never heard plantronics buying headset grew appreciate lot years usage. recently discovered plantronics long history headsets even apollo missions used headsets moon. makes sense. "one small set man, one giant leap away bt headsets. houston, problem". 
 bought one work used year complaints, bought one wife uses constantly loves it. highly recommended. 
 one best headsets there, used many unit one beat. issues whatsoever, great quality easy use.. 
 good sounding ways usable 18 wheeler. mic overwhelmed 75 100db ambient background noise. good noise canceling environments.not good outside wind even new mic grill. 
 product done alot me. i've used multiple phones even ps3 never failed me. great quality headset! easy use link to. dont regret buying it. 
 chose product based reading many reviews plantronics motorola headsets primarily amazon. happy purchase. others said, never know headset. battery lasts day, charger day never even remotely necessary. i've talked 3 4 hours days, day i'm talking, never run battery down. charge get home evening. volume enough (and i'm bit hard hearing). it's comfortable leave time i'm work. works equally well either ear. connects quickly works great. sometimes seems bit hard get on, times slips place. we're talking sometimes takes 10 seconds fiddling get ear right. usually, slips on. wear glasses think that's issue there. highly recommended would purchase w/o question. 
 small ears sometimes use gadget 8 hour conference calls. reason comfort battery life paramount. stays pretty comfortable battery go 4-6 hours. think that's expect bluetooth headset. 
 work verizon wireless tech support department yet use better bluetooth headset. i've owned 4 last year; jabra, motorola, one another plantronics. i've used several different ones time testing process, easily best i've used. earlier plantronics also good well. jabra didn't good noise-reduction motorola terrible purchase altogether. headset say ease superb. great sound, picks little way ambient noise, charge lasts forever, seemingly!update: originally purchased device 2 years ago, di replace back july. why? messenger bag got stepped on. used every day, reason get new headset physically damaged. guess headset got replace it? one! previous one worked 2 years stopped working got stepped on, one i'm sticking long make them. 
 first bought headset $30. worked well 10 (maybe 12) minutes fell apart. so, would suggest considering anything $100.unless consider one.when returned first headset fry's electronics asked popular model was. sales guy said plantronics 510. tried felt really good. i've using two months love pieces. works well moment bought (actually, better, needed charging).positives:1) comfort. biggest attribute looking wear lot. putting usually forget within two minutes. light weight easy ears. remember somebody calls hear beeping ears. flick wrist, easily converts left right ear feel extremely comfortable.2) sturdy. travel lot airports kind belongings, especially ones crammed bag. thing taken lickings keeps going. must better first one bought fell apart nothing.3) great sound quality. i've used airports, casinos, convention centers. always hear party without problems i've never anybody complain can't hear me.4) simple work. probably difficult thing getting recognized phone. isn't complicated took 2 minutes, searching directions it. picking phone easy hitting button.on side note, two bluetooth cellphones switch two automatically without hassle. ease switching considering getting phone base use office line home well. know somebody uses problems it.negatives:1) wish way turn blinking blue light. drives crazy especially driving night. half times see blink think i'm getting pulled over. also, keeps blinking whether using usually cover hand towel charging night. seems inherent bluetooth device.2) ummmm.... can't think negatives.so, highly suggest checking one out. can't say everybody i've learned two ears exactly alike. biggest thing looking comfort. completely comfortable might you. find comfortable would highly recommend picking anything else especially since price soooo right. 
 owned four bluetooth headsets. far comfortable easiest use. problems sore ears models (motorola, jabra bt350 bt800) sometimes forget wearing it. good sound quality, fits well, stays matter what. perfect headset! 
 bought reccomendation friend. brother bought motorolla earpiece $30 paid mine. hates love mine. people never realize talking headset. get 3 ear speakers different sizes attach one comfortable ear.best addition cell phone ever bought. 
 like people purchased multiple bluetooth headsets struggled poor reception, can't hear caller can't hear me. plantronics voyager 510 headset didn't problems. device simply worked used years.the headset operate 6 hours talk time 100 hours standby time ideal use traveling especially driving. noise canceling microphone worked well people could hear background noise like wind rain windshield. earpiece comfortable wear light enough forget on.the headset feature operate two bluetooth devices simultaneously smart technology feature connects proper device touch button. headset boom swivels fit location best even folds small form easy storage. head set operate 33 feet bluetooth device phone briefcase back seat car still take calls.the unit also features adaptive frequency hopping find free channel avoid interference wifi/wlan sources. tried 10 bluetooth devices years one simply one performed best.

 easy set use, excellent sound quality, light comfortable. can't go wrong price. 
 complaints here. excellent sound quality - volume turned nice loud. fewest "bluetooth clicking noises" bluetooth device i've used. hardly hear unless walk far away source.i voyager 510 paired treo 650 skype laptop (using anycom usb 250 reviewed previously) headset picks call whoever rings first every time. love it!! skype call comes in, headset rings - call comes treo 650 headset rings. what's like???i love fit - think it's best i've tried on. also scala 700x light could imagine headset. but, it's almost little light (and fragile). honestly, like need backup. think it, believe wife inherited scala 700x.the 510 feels like it's built take abuse think plus yet it's lighter expected - honest. it's around little afraid might little heavy. i'm pleasantly surprised it's light. mean fit perfect, could go running wearing certainly work gym without worries.i haven't put "wind cancellation" test yet i'll update review. but, honestly, saw positive reviews amazon (1200 so?) many treo 650 users, figured fairly safe bet i'm satisfied purchase far.the scala works great treo 650 too. it's hard tell one sounds louder - i'll experiment little write winner. 
 second headset replacing motorola one came cell phone. people call tell sound clear end cannot tell using headset - sounds like talking phone. case first one. travel lot wear headset long periods. ear get tired sore on. headset seems well balanced never seems like going fall regardless doing. also like folds flat easy carrying shirt pocket. 
 wonderful bluetooth headset. great sound minimal background noise end phone. connected easily sanyo katana ii cellular phone well bluetooth usb device use skype vonage talk accounts. complaint, volume control could easier adjust. end using volume control phone bit easier see level setting at. 
 let's get it. reading review shopping new bluetooth headset, go ahead finishing reading next couple sentences did... buy plantronics voyager 510 amazon (for $45.00 review). 10 different headsets used make hundreds calls types environments, since really rate products curve, currently better choice time (things doubt change one day). stable, ergonomic, static free (there thing completely static free wireless product), efficient it's battery usage, comfortable (a somewhat subjective attribute), bang buck, satisfying use, 5 star rated bluetooth headset money buy. really complain one thing... sensitive microphone pick wind noise moderately windy conditions (in spite noise cancelling technology), certainly true every headset used probably true headsets come it. 
 simply awesome, best one ever had, sticking one 1 motorola, 1 nokia 1 samsung.

 reader,i've sony ericsson, logitech mobile freedom, cario scala 500, plantronics discovery 640, finally voyager 510. let say prior favorite logitech little bulky disconnected phone calls (annoying).having said enjoy plantronics voyager 510. higher model, discovery 640 doesn't stand chance. yes 640 smaller, cooler-looking, features good. 640 windguard, noice-cancelling tech, talk time short. extra battery charger give try say boosts talk time not. can't talk charge time. sheesh.okay, voyager 510, love it. great fit. seems plantronics come new version 510. foam mic boom removeable built much like logitech is. voice sound quality top notch. i've recorded sounds clear. even notice difference noise-cancelling technology tv background, voice still clear. noice-cancelling important.pros:clear, audible soundmic sensitive voice callers clearwind-guardnoise-cancelling technology (must have!)fit - stays confortably give 3 earphone-like inserts (perfect)cons:the thing mic boom seems rub cheek close sometimes make scratching sound caller (since it's rubbing cheek). haven't heard complaint reviewers maybe it's unique me. don't big cheeks don't get it. 
 wasn't sure wanted purchase another bluetooth headset last one purchased, motorola hs815, terrible. people saying couldn't hear much static. figured would thing next time. boy wrong. headset terrific. give pros cons:pros:clarityease usebattery lifevery comfortable weardoes fall offthe con is, sometimes difficulty intially putting becasue wear glasses. occassionally use two hands put ear correctly.i would definitely recommend item. 
 smallest cutest bluetooth, certainly reliable experience. i've year still works perfectly, say previous bluetooth devices. 
 i've 3 headsets already, one something didn't like. hesitated buy one, despite great reviews, wanted one didn't give 'telemarketer' look. top things looking were: sound quality, comfort, battery life. unit delivers 3 counts. sounds fantastic, it's really comfortable (especially jabra eargels ear piece), battery lasts long time. looking back, one bought first place. recommended. 
 headset reasonable price provides best hearing talking matter am. size meam heavy. 
 last bluetooth device owned poor reception. sound quality device clear enough hear car windows down. would recommend anyone. great ear piece! 
 plantronics 510 comfortable wear hours doesn't feel like fall ear. mates easily treo 650 also bluetooth-enable laptop, makes possible use laptop voip calls. reception good, volume adequate people talk say voice clear. controls bit stiff, others said. means good tactile feedback -- know you've pressed button.one marginal shortcoming: 510's clarity isn't good enough replace wired plantronics usb headset use dictating dragon systems "naturally speaking" voice recognition software laptop. would stretch wireless headset.prices vary widely; shop around. 
 best product gotten cell phone many blue tooths. one best people hear clearly noise background hear well.... 
 everyone else says, sounds clear, comfortable, sounds crystal clear people listening you. sounds better phone itself. 
 i've 2 years pleased quality, durability, reliability. surprisingly comfortable considering girth piece goes behind ear. past headsets earloops horribly painful short time, one wear hours, barely noticing it. came 3 different earpieces - one small, one large, one teardrop shaped - fit problem. sound quality good enough people frequently comment clear sound nearly always using car. wind cancellation really insufficient, major issue me...i use windows mostly up. frequently leave thing overnight still use couple days afterwards loss power. talk time least 6 hours claimed stand-by time measured days. people troubled proprietary power cord, it's small matter household-type plug car charge driving need be, though cannot charged used simultaneously. came see wanted upgrade another plantronics model pass headset daughter, think i'm going keep buy model.update:still 5 star item second one. 2.5 years first one broke top earloop. taped sports tape kept using without problems, figured matter time didn't work anymore replaced it. others said new 510s junk, i've using mine 5 months it's exactly great original. broken one still working, too. 
 update 11/11/2008my wife's died two weeks ago. emailed company explaining bought amazon mentioned within warranty period. hear anything week, then, replacement appeared house, sent via express mail. refurb, condition, looks works perfectly. awesome customer service. one reason get product!i used month, love it. searching decent bluetooth headset, using month, tell great. sound good clear. complaints anyone speak with, usually don't even know using headset. two negatives, really bad. first, turning easy. really bad thing, little awkward. second complaint would take half star, is, usb car charger cannot work it, buy seperate charger. much easier answer hang up, compared others used. comfortable, sometimes forget wearing it., witnessed wife often reminds tha ti still wearing it. bought wife's set died needed new one. ehem, seems somehow ended one got old piece &$#%(@ (insert guess brand here) used it. well, loves well, though also complains on/off button. also note verizon razor, often would recognize verizon blue tooth headset had, problem quickly hooking headset. really love would recommend anyone. lastly, battery life good. 
 two motorola bluetooth headsets either clear signal speaking someone echo. one got plantronics far best ever i've read best market right now. would advise bluetooth shoppers stay away motorola bluetooth headsets. 
 plantronics voyager 510 bluetooth headset perfect reception transmission.- ear piece & microphonethe reception ear piece clear loud. microphone works flawlessly faithfully relay voice receiving end without little distortion muffles.- bluetooth functionthe bluetooth provides rock-solid connectivity. i've never problems broken sporadic connection problems.- formthe ear piece comfortable. take effort, however, put headphone. somewhat awkward maneuver involves use hands pull "loop" open go around back ear simultaneously wrestling ear piece direct ear.the plantronics voyager 510 bluetooth headset functions flawlessly. however, found design headset makes inconvenience put on. apart flawed ergonomics, headset perfect - 4.5 stars! 
 waited review product see time would show good, show that. best blue tooth device ever seen used already convinced 3 people switch. battery lasts would guess 8 hrs talk time 2-3 weeks without charge using little day. sound better using phone people hear without static. improvement think put battery meeter let know much power left instead dying you. try charge every 1-2 weeks dies great. 
 bought two gf myself, high quality easy use. like it! 
 unit always synchs works perfectly. every time. comfortable good volume, easy adjust end calls. hassles. strong battery life. subtle much behind ear, definitely goofy looking star-trek-look devices bright led's ear hardware. (i think law wear one those, wear two, thus identifying hopeless techno-geek.) 
 reviews available product amazon website really helped make great decision.this model may "latest" technology it's enough me. use car issues raised driving safety. feel better hands wheel, eyes road.i'm device geek really works requirements have.simple use, set 10 min max.fits fine, activate connection go road buttons small difficult activate already behind ear. 
 people talk using earpiece can't even tell bluetooth. windnoise static. little big, sacrifice something order get good sound. 
 jabra headset work pda/phone, works well. but, new ca law regarding phone use car, needed one could switch two phones. remarkably well.although cannot switch conversation easily (you hold call button beeps twice release call phone mic/speaker could pick call, easy way switch back), handles obvious uses well. one phone starts ringing, headset correctly selects pick call - perfect.the headset comfortable long calls, good balance ear.the microphone stalk movable product brief suggests, fold per se (sticks matter positioned). folding mic power off, shame, although battery life seems really good.sound quality good speaker appears good end, although heard side know sure.only downside vs. jabra usb charger (small cord plug laptop traveling), drag along transformer. 
 plantronics voyager 510 absolute work horse past nearly 2 years. say workhorse mean it. put 5 hours talk time device 5 days week well year. used weekly 4 hour commute, day office, night talk family hotel number usages. know device using familiar turning blinker car.the good:1. great noise filtering. microphone great job filtering ambient noise including wind.2. battery excellent lasts days standby least 6 hours talking.3. multipoint technology. technology rocks. work (blackberry) personal cell phone synched device time call answer either without pairing hassles.4. pairs device setup simply pressing primary button.5. volume buttons earpiece.6. comes multiple earpieces comfort.7. stable ear. doesn't feel fall out.8. durable. used hard years started fall apart. still works though.9. shares common power supply many plantronics devices ease power sharing.10. larger competitors light.the good:1. bigger devices.2. earpieces prone fall don't stay secured 6 months.as see really don't much bad say device. replacing 2 years use earpiece fell can't find pack came it. still works! replaced unit plantronics discovery 925 might like even better. money though cannot beat voyager 510 opinion. 5 stars! 
 best bluetooth owned performance importantly fit. comfortable ear inside ear, could keep hours even remember there. sound quality features excellent worked advertised. used various phones. used every day 2 years started break hinge. used stuff purse without special case protection, surprised finally gave in. see product sold lot $$$ now, don't think paid $40 it. great deal great value. see sale again, would buy it. 
 i've able carry conversations bedroom bathroom phone sits living room! reception amazing. travel beyond 30 ft different parts apartment still get clear calls. friends can't tell i'm bt headset. fact, say it's clearer wired earpiece. problem dropped calls plummeted almost nothing position phone decent area talk wherever plantronics bt.this ugly headset compared others, works! there's point cute bt can't use it. use smallest earpieces provided, stays pretty well. 
 yes, three headsets. two car, one use house. chose put best one, one, car along second cheap one, backup. i'm terrible remembering charge guys up! i'm cheap purchase car charger...this really great headset. i've never problem people able hear it's comfortable wear. battery lasts long time, one reason forget charge it. battery dies, use backup headset charge favorite!the headsets cheapy models i've purchase amazon goldbox deal, also good. around $10 work fine. comfortable wear sound quality sharp, speaking with. wear cheapy ones 15 minutes, ear start ache little. wear one day wanted wouldn't bother all.i would purchase one sure. i've mine 18 months i'm sure point trash need another. i'm really happy headset. 
 best bluetooth had. clear comfortable. others tried hurt ear one never does. it's like aren't even wearing it. clear people talking well clear talking. can't go wrong headset all. 
 couldn't happier this. embarrassed "large" size may want consider less insecure. 
 never bluetooth headset 510. use motorola i870 nextel phone. headset works great, sometimes disconnects moment press button side headset reconnects. talk time awesome gotten almost 5 hours continuous talk time device. range isn't bad think get 30 feet i870. crappy nextel phone could keep quality headset. since i870 battery goes dead like 1 1/2 extended batter pack plug charge. however, it's plugged still use 510 wander house still talk phone. almost replaces phone could dial it. best part get far away gets little static know come back closer sound quality clears up. everyone spoken headset says sounds nice clear.overall would suggest headset anyone works, it's cheap wears extremely comfortable ear. 
 i've earpiece years still works well day one . never problems; never falls ear. sound great. 
 ever since bought headset become fan it. comfortable wear whole day without even feeling anythin on, voice crystal clear easy use. pairs perfectly nokia 6610 well dell laptop use voip calls mobile phone calls. also service great. received package right estimated date never followup anyone. superb product !!! 
 difficult find bluetooth headset work well palm treo. one does. good quality sound cut out. 
 i've owned used several different models couple years, 510 hands best i've used far. battery life excellent, fit excellent, sound quality mic quality excellent. got mine price temporarily dipped $40, cannot beat price. highly recommended. 
 gave one away 2 years ago, failed stay paired bb pearl. decided give another try motoqglobal (att), thoroughly satisfied. reception great, audible signal every function, including receipt e-mail text messages. great purchase $40!!update 8/5/2009: stopped working, warning. warranty, unfortunately. 
 previously used motorola hs850 hs820 two problems each. insuffcient volume insecure attachment ear. whenever moved, motorola headsets wiggled made feel fall off. never still annoying. volume problem part related this. contact ear wasn't firm ambient noise headsets let coupled relatively low volume meant press headset ear hear clearly.i satisfied plantronics 510. choice 3 interchangable ear cushions, great volume, crisp output decent range make unbeatable. battery life somewhat less motorola headsets, purchased extra charger home. power button small, using minor problem resolves little practice. sound crisp clear. range good better motorola sets. 
 headset proved pleasant surprised tryinga bunch others. definitely comfortable, hadgreat sound actually fits ear. variable ear piecesare great touch unit fit larger ears better.sound quality good. downside slightly hardto manipulate buttons. minor.if you've tried bunch can't get good fit, try one,it'll probably work - me. 
 3rd one ran one car wore one out. good. 
 read lot buying headset kind nervous bad reviews read must say worthy headset really good, hear perfectly using it, doesn't hurts ear anything, don't use like everyday battery last almost week far. samsung captivate didn't problem pairing using it.5 stars! 
 several years used logitech bluetooth cell phone, worked great, always uncomfortable. snapped two, decided voyager 510! wow, work great, very, comfortable! fact, honestly say actually forget wearing it, something cannot say previous device. thinking headset, cannot go wrong one! five stars! 
 voyager 510 comfortable wear easy setup. speaker volume good little static. plus doesn't look like block plastic hanging ear. highly recommend headset. 
 last 2 years, tried 10 different models bluetooth headsets different manufacturers. far, voyager 510 best around performance - clarity, loudness, battery standby time, pairing, static free, ...if pick one negative thing say would size. quite bit bigger competing products small prize pay superb performance.get one, you'll glad do. 
 i've tried several different bluetooth headsets motorola cardo, ended returning giving away them. kept plantronics 510 simply best ever tried. hear static, cracks pops, audio quality tops caller, it's comfortable doesn't flop around ear like headsets move.while plantronics may seem slightly larger headsets (mainly larger part goes behind ear), comfortable wear use, light. slips pocket bag easily bluetooth headset.the plantronics 510 comes 3 different sizes earbuds fit ear perfectly speaker goes (or close to) ear, unlike headsets speaker rests outside ear really good getting high volume windy/noisy environments. also plantronics boom mic folds partway towards mouth. way better headsets mic way ear closer mic mouth, better sound less background noise callers hear. everyone i've talked using plantronics raved good sound, especially compared crappy motorola's i've tried previously.the voyager 510 great battery life talking standby. bluetooth range superb-i effectively walk around condo room room, talking phone, yet cellphone remains computer desk-it really goes 30 feet, walls too. fact headset even remember pairing multiple devices icing cake.i really recommend headset. it's money well spent. go ahead try others, would educated guess end one eventually, like did.*there slightly misleading bit text instruction manual regards charging aware of: states led illuminate red charging illuminate blue done charging. however actually blinks red charging turns solid blue complete. 
 tried many, one one use driving noisy truck. 
 three identical phones three different bluetooth headsets. plantronics explorer 320, motorola h350, plantronics voyager 510. three, plantronics superior comfort sound quality, 510 outstanding respects. although little bulkier others, much comfortable callers actually feel sounds better using handset. result, don't use handset unless to! 
 strength high rating huge reviewer feedback amazon, bought bluetooth device -- first bluetooth headset ever. finally phone bluetooth capability, keenly interested wireless headset wouldn't cord tangle issues corded headsets.this device exactly wanted do. piece cake setup verizon samsung u540 phone. wouldn't even need crack open user manual except discover 4-digit code plug-in phone (it's 0000, btw). that, it's snap turn link phone.my important concern voice clarity, sending receiving. thus far, several hours use, tell voice reception hear crystal clear. crackling, hollowing echoing. end, i've anyone complain unable hear voice voice coming across muddled -- interestingly, i've complaints using old, corded headset!the power button *is* small *is* tad difficult depress might want, then, won't accidentally turn turn device way it's designed. agree others -- turn device putting ear, you're turning off.as noise canceling, wife tested device noisy home four small kids, pleasantly surprised well headset communicated voice ambient noise room.using volume control headset pretty easy do. note control voice volume either phone handset volume control control plantronics headset. reviewers complaining low volume headset, it's likely one two volume controls turned low, perhaps mobile phone using doesn't much way signal output. plantronics headset *plenty* loud volume that's want.as ear comfort, found comfortable, although haven't worn day long. talked friend hour yesterday, absolutely discomfort all. device comes three earpieces (small, medium large). use medium great results.the phone fits snuggly ear doesn't move around all, although i'm jogging even walking much using it.i like discreet look "guts" device behind ear, thin microphone side face, rather fat motorola designs.other reviewers cautioned headset breaking, take gentle care handling it. suspect won't problem falling apart.i can't speak battery life, lengthy phone call, recharge it's ready next call might make. charging easy doesn't take long, either.in sum, i'm satisfied device. long doesn't break, it's performance comfortable design make excellent choice. 
 bought razr v3 phone july go 7-eleven speak wireless prepaid service. phone received amazon.com made hong kong market, came outlet plug adapter u.s. customers. (the ac adapter universal voltage, slim paper manual english.) phone quadband fully unlocked, used anywhere world.i really like razr phone. it's solid voice quality excellent. speak wireless runs at&t; t-mobile networks reception quality vary, overall razr excellent job pulling much signal possible. moto phones, brightness screen adjusted, ringer type volume easily changed. metallic keypad takes little getting used to, pretty comfy use.the camera vga takes good-quality pictures there's plenty light. video capture jerky limited 15 seconds, that's probably weakest feature me. bluetooth linkup sony ericsson earpiece works fine. battery life admirable; don't use phone much, maybe 10 minutes week, need recharge every 8 days so.because i've owned many moto's like razr's interface, since feels familiar, understand confuse users new moto scene. overall, though, don't think it's harder use sony nokia.what really impresses build quality phone. nowhere find thing made, material fit finish excellent. i'm happy inexpensive purchase.

 yah ave correct driver pc usb charge phone 
 treo 650 great device. combines cellular phone, pda, wireless functionality, allowing check e-mail, surf web, make phone calls, keep contacts calendar.be sure buy aftermarket usb cable, allow charge sync treo 650 time headset adaptor.by downloading aftermarket applications (do search google), make play internet radio, play mp3's 1gb sd card, play great games, even use access internet laptop road. here's use:1. directory assistant (by rick whitt)- program allows easily look dial busines residential telephone numbers get driving directions maps, without waiting various web pages load. know sounds like silly app, thought too, use time avoid dialing 411 paying $1.25 per call. best all, free (but make donation).2. atom smash red mercury software- great arkanoid style game.3. backupbuddy vfs blue nomad - back apps treo.4. blocks electron hut - free tetris clone5. chitchat lite - free msn messenger client6. froggy tim smith - frogger clone.7. galax tim smith - galaxian clone.8, pacman horaco ho - duh.9. pocket tunes normsoft - great mp3 internet radio player. much better control audio included real player (which plays mp3s, internet radio).10. pdanet june fabrics - allows connect laptop treo use internet. works great.11. filez nosleep software - basic file manager palm os.12. voice dial - download - dial calls using sound voice. free say numbers, must buy dial name.13. pocket dvd studio - allows compress dvd movies fit sd card, making treo movie player. 
 agree poster. blame phone broke screen. monitor home bad dropped table. phone best smart phone there. people issues resets, conflict many apps load usually solved. love phone. also...do rate 1 star say phone good, verizon bad. unfair since lowers rating. ignore guy broke phone...this good phone. 
 first "smart phone" can't compare previous models. however, tell great need:1. great wireless service coverage. verizon best coverage provider. even signal elevators stairwells.2. text messaging. job requires carry pager. phone, forwarded pager. carry one device. great responding pages initiating message dialog. 1,000 messages plan, plenty. handy meetings able ping people back desk information.3. organizer. installed software pc work, outlook calendar available wherever take phone. one thing didn't like lack options initial sync. wound "frequent contacts" outlook phone - includes anyone ever sent e-mail to. luckily, easy filer contacts delete them. sure set device overrides desktop contacts.i don't use web e-mail pieces data package expensive (~$45/mo). unless need send receive attachments, sms sufficient e-mail. web queries done sms services like google provides.overall it's great! 
 briefly:this inexpensive wire allows easy transfer media files - photos, drm-free music, videos, etc. sony ericsson phone computer usb port.it useful phone users interested 'phone calls only' plan willing pay phone company extra monthly charge internet service.it needed sony ericsson phones support standard usb interface 'normal' usb cable work._______________________________________extended discussion:i'm surprised wife's sony ericsson's tm506 came without usb interface wire. 'free' phone phone company wished could nickel dime us forever 'plans' make us pay various monthly service fees privilege downloading couple songs uploading photos videos made using phone's camera. sony ericsson's phones lacking standard usb interface probably intimidating enough persuade users succumb phone company's demand extra $10 per month 'web' access. need way.since wanted phone made phone calls inexpensive wire allows us squeeze extra functionality free phone allowing us transfer media files phone connecting computer. it's easy, requires software installation don't need pay one extra dime phone company privilege.positives:- eliminates need pay phone company internet connection- software installation required- file transfer actually faster- allows easy media files transfer computer - drm-free files easily send phone- even users internet plan may appreciate ability connect phone directly computerconcerns:- minimal computer skills expected - ability recognize specific file types copy move to/from specific foldersconclusion: recommended sony ericsson phone user, without media internet plan. 
 use charge phone laptop/pc. also use debrand add pics, music, apps computer phone.. works great. 
 surprised quickly received it. little hesitant opened package small zip lock bag, manufacturer brand packaging. tried works great oem models. would recommend it. also, perfectly priced! 
 hard write review cable. works supposed do, 
 special installs necessary. cable, sony ericsson w3001 showed windows xp system another drive. works great. cool. 
 needed usb connector old sony ericsson w518a - works great! pc sees phone connected problem! 
 im pleased little charger. blue light indicates whether it's on, phone charges fast. five minutes it's three quarters charged bring dead! would definitely recommend someone else. 
 needed power source mini usb. exactly needed. also delivered fast. use power rca hdmi converter roku 3. 
 yea, basically. it's phone charger motorola razor, guess what? works it. also works phones. 
 charger come charge mp3 players like it's supposed to. shipping longer paid for. however thought charger disconnected charger cable could come base connect computer i'll order another charger need do. 
 charged phone. actually, bought six would correct say &#34;they&#34; charged phone.why would get six? one bedroom, one kitchen, one living room, one home office, one car, one work. phone full electricity, i'll tell that. 
 incredibly frustrated purchased product find work charge phone specifically bought for. christmas present someone relied car charger years. she'd plug car outlet let sit car charged. assumed solved problem. unfortunately, motorola razr dinosaur, i'd special order actual manufacturer.here's surprise part......i moved finally found kindle. it's kindle touch, nothing special (not fire paperwhite). it's simply black white touch screen. unfortunately, couldn't find charger, matter looked! even so, charger came kindle would take 2-3 hours fully charge, it's nearly dead. so,i decided try kindle see would fit. surprise, fits like glove! that, also charged kindle hour. dead, refused turn plugged charger. still, fully charged within hour. go figure! 
 love compact headset. fits well ear, comfortable. mic picks well, clear voice coming through. pleased purchase going get spares sure. feels like solid build durable. 
 i've using headset (although mine doesn't call answer button like version does) years now. it's first headset i've ever used comfortable great sound quality directions, i've used 3 different phones years results. hear people perfectly i've never single comment much less complaint sound quality people. comes two different size gels ear, spare you're totally set. depending shape ear may prefer one ear gels.this headset comfortable wear ear hours time without bothering me, stays snugly cheek doesn't flop around slightest. don't know gotten bad reviews site, sites averages least 4 stars many, many reviews. bottom line, i'd gladly pay 2 3 times amazon charging headset, especially answer call/end button it. 
 love these, bought brands break months. last good product. 
 highly recommend anyone using cordless home phone. fan bluetooth, seems easiest use around house. 
 worry headset would work samsungt619, since latter compatibility list. hand, i've heard bluetooth devices standard (i.e. version 1.2) compatibility problem. turned absolutely smooth connecting samsung. headset flash even vibrate call's coming.the headset amazingly light weight. can't even imagine lithium battery sitting leather-weight body hold 7 hours' talking.i spent $10 headset couldn't happy. 
 first question headsets comparing to. see reviews motorola hs850, jabra bt250v, plantronics 320 explorer reference. let's consider headset terms four key performance categories: pairing, sound quality, ease use, comfort.pairing - able pair headset lg vx-9800 first try. instructions manual straightforward repeat hear. experience similar bt250v.sound quality - really top area question headset. i'm happy report headset delivers nicely area. able use less max volume setting cases definite progress headsets used. end, important don't volume louder need otherwise people hear echo due close proximity speaker microphone. however, found echo less issue hs850.ease use - key jabra headset holding multifunction button flashes. turns headset pairing. hear reports people winding redialing last number called trying turn headset off. don't wait flash, happen. i've also heard reported pairing, shouldn't case start pairing headset turned off. finally, volume buttons easy use. use headset right ear can't speak like headset flipped buttons top.comfort - also found headset clear winner area three used. wear glasses ear hook necessity. think also hit sweet spot placement speaker. speaker raised surface headset opposed hs850 flush main body headset. however, go ear like bt250v plantronics 320. guess another way put rests outside ear canal speaker close inside ear without actually so. think maximizes comfort contributes better sound quality. finally, vibrate feature disturbing used it. don't let stop though something turn desire. 
 comfortable wear, good reception, price ~$22 plus shipping unreal. prefer style star trek earpieces, one's boom mic extends ear models series. 
 bought phone ofr in-laws months ago works great. unfortunately, don't get see phone often. unless something better, next phone. 
 one person said review "while phone thin, bulky handle, seems flimsy."i could disagree more. feels extremly sturdy, tiny phone, thin. weighs would expect, don't mind feels bit well made.i version motorola v557 well year now. got free, gave friend needed phone badly. cingular customer. wanting new phone anyways worked well.i got nokia 6102 one two weeks ago. say good deal price didn't like all. returned got razr. spent bit razr, reasonable. (...).the razor simple phone, good phone. comes pretty case make happy every time open it! good quality camera (it's digital camera, like good quality web cam) find easy read, dial everything clear spaced nicley.i got black version, nick named kit night rider car, reminds it. yeah dork!i read complaints phone didn't come enough stuff, well it's launch price point would say yeah overpriced. come good deal book.i pleased far! pleased enough come write review!i also love cool accessories get, including vynle(sp?) skins color want.

 4th body glove "cellsuit" case i've owned, ever wore broke, simply i've bought four different phones. bought one motorola razr. fit perfect, cut-ous line phone ports, speakers, etc. phone actually fits razr slightly better body glove use motorola v551.it provides protection drops, elements, etc. externally internally, whereas many cases, including popular hard cases razrs protect exterior.a people written reviews phone doesn't close swell without case. closes fine. add slight thickness edge phone case it, basically closes way, almost exactly without case, case, won't hear phone cover "click shut" closed like front suddenly lose pops open. case great value works perfectly. 
 really fit phone like glove - looks good - think last long time. worth every penny! prompt delivery. recommend anyone razr. 
 i've using mine 4 years it's finally starting show wear wraparound earpiece, issues shutting unexpectedly. all, four years, it's great purchase. although i'm still using mine daily, i'm ready purchase new one, one battery best, simply carry aaa batteries car, whenever one dies, put new one go. worrying bringing house charge, forgetting take back out, losing charging cord. love it's convenient leave car 100% time, it's always sure there. 
 motorola h300 ultimate handsfree headset want headset able use forever. say this? because, non-removable rechargeable battery like handsfree headsets. instead, operated single aaa battery. got it, cannot verify performance battery, knowing won't throw away couple years worth it. features include call accept, call deny, mute, hold, voice dialing, 3 way calling, turn blinking blue light (if you're inclined). even though takes aaa battery, it's size comparable rechargeable headset. may 2 mm thicker, length most. works great nonsense kind headset. want basic headset expensive ones, want security changing battery, headset you. problems duration battery operation, update review accordingly (check date review gauge long since purchase... update, problem). 
 keep one desk, one bag, one car.battery life fantastic -- standby talk. i'm afraid turning on, pop battery compartment thumb. easy pie.pairs easily.perfect comfortable ears.great sound, ways.i've used devices old motorola pebl iphone (1st gen) palm pre.i've bought inherited 7 bluetooth devices getting one years ago, thinking would improve something already well-made. didn't...so got two h300's.turns aaa battery route (i use rechargeable eneloops) works great me... years, it's never bother... don't even notice it. there's nothing plug wall, extra charger, i've always got spare aaa charged house, bag, car "emergencies."i love thing... back amazon today order one mom try convince use one things. liked idea aaa battery maybe plug ones wall slowed much.if get one amazon sellers get one new half/third cost todays date (3-29-2011).i'm sure technology bluetooth headsets improved that's said high-end pos received friends tried get "the best" 3x price. think i'll wait awhile longer messing good thing got going moto h300s.good luck! 
 purchased device reading several reviews focused primarily price. i've 3 days great. use 700w, despite review, works great 700w issue whatsoever. yes helps side phone, carry phone holster side, moved left side talking considerable static showed.volume great (i struggling volume wired hands free headsets, problem volume.)configuration, took 2 minutes, 1 minute reading manual another minute it. manual 2 pages, pretty quick easy, follow steps golden.distance, hip would get statis, 2-4 ft good, beyond that, forget it. considering price, complaint that, hip ear need. 
 second one wore first one three years broke well worth money spent works great pairs easy last far talk time full eight ten hours worth money. 
 headset inexpensive, sound quality great. paired samsung d807 couple seconds. ear piece goes ear, outside noises less distracting. old motorola headsets, people complained couldn't hear me. hasn't issue 320. 
 owned unit three weeks now. got unit close price, feel definitely got money's worth. never owned blue-tooth head set nothing compare to. read reviews internet decided unit wanted price range. sound clear intelligible ends,... far tell, even car, bought for...(to use driving)... fairly comfortable 2 hours ware, becomes somewhat uncomfortable. think adjustment may possible make feel even comfortable, lot comfort depends sensitivity, ear head shape. paired phone, razr v3, reconnects time matter seconds (usually). take longer. buying headset never hear plantronics before, would say products good build quality good sound. liked units motorola headsets mostly way fit rather sound quality issue. 
 recently bought new cell phone (sony ericsson z520a) bluetooth. spent days researching various headsets there, soon discovered handful appeared worth buying -- $100 $150, want spend. came across accident, couldn't find negative comments common headsets price range. granted they're bluetooth v1.2, they're light, built-in rechargable battery, quite comfortable wear, good sound quality. addition, pairing process quite simple.if priorities quality sound, comfort, built-in battery, reasonable price, hard beat. like much bought second one wife. 
 item came within time great got mom currently still using order year ago. 
 purchased headset use cell phone. turns use computer love them. easy use, long battery lfe sound great. may bit uncomfortable odd back head design headphones kind pressure due design. time notice presure wear hours. short term problems. way, wear glasses may culprit.i'd buy again. 
 product, ordinary earphones moto680 cellphone stero radio, also moto blue tooth earphone, one good, long time power supply heavier single ear bluetooth.volumn control good, loud enough. single ear bt control times, may hear nothing walking busy street windy days. one give availability.drawback: 1. phone call comes in, wait longer time single ear bt. 2. size big, put regualr pocket. 3. pad easily drops, may lose one two soon. used glue.anyway, good one, talk 2 hours meeting several times one time full recharging.i love it. 
 durable. sounds great. mic provides good sound endof connection. like wrap-around fit (walkman-style headphones look dorky - wrap around better). although.. 30 minutes tips ears become sore learning cope with. use motorola l2 cell phone anycom 250 usb dongle skype. one get. competing plantronics product -- fact two -- broke place due use plastic high-stress areas. motorola design much smarter. 
 got headset last week wednesday using ever since. read lot reviews found much information could even ordering it. reading mixed reviews, find myself.so is:i use motorola q, also bad phone, works perfectly fine it. paired without problems stays connected want stay connected. opportunity really test battery life yet, tested approx 2 hours charges holds fine 2 hours.incoming sound quality perfect. actually little loud, lower volume.outgoing sound also much better according girlfriend heard previous sony hbh-660, says sound quality much better. even windows rolled going 65, says hear fine, although says sounds like faucet running. question dsp works since doesn't really filter windnoise.the system pretty sleek gives multiple charging options. worry running battery unless talk consistently 3 hours time.one gripe button plastic. button easier press require much pressure does. plastic seems kind cheap, probably makes thing light, barely even notice on. use better plastic better chrome paint doesn't scratch chip off.overall, give 2 thumbs best headset used far. 
 airports watching people talking space huge clam attached ear flashing blue light swore bluetooth. headset plantronics extremely small, nicely packaged, paired immediately blackberry 7100t.the packaging cleverly done headset simple silver cylinder weights mere 9 grams. audio quality high recent 7100t software upgrade increased volume levels acceptable. variety included ear pieces ensure you're likely find comfortable fit. i've getting 2-3 hours talk time single charge perfect adequate people.as small minus, button connect/disconnect/turn-on takes bit getting used feels bit mushy missing positive click confirm selection.if you're worried compatibility, plantronics website provides pull selector mfg/phone confirm.

 sony ericsson w600 reviewupdated note: phone sent back manufacturer twice bluetooth problems. upon thinking phone more, i'd say software buggy lot people. please take consideration buying.i bought phone early december oh-so-not-low price $390 letstalk.com. (am) seven months two-year contract, yes, paid full price. :eek:in past, i've owned major brands phones (motorola, nokia, samsung, sony ericsson, sharp) right got phone, happy motorola v551 owner. initially, wanted sony ericsson w800, without 850mhz band cingular customer, wasn't going risk it.in short, love phone. date, it's best phone i've owned. don't think it's worth $390 paid it, that's really fault. i'm impatient wanted phone reeeeeally bad didn't want wait dropped price (if ever will). going cover major components phone list pros cons. mine cingular-branded phone, keep mind talk certain features.camera: i've camera phones one. i'll preface section saying 100s others said: it's camera phone. it's going quality make even decent 4x6 print. good moments you're thinking, "oh!

 gave headset wife uses time. works great comfortable. 
 first want say, low cost bluetooth headset great value. lot bluetooth heasets choose market today. many stylish bells whistles, $30.00 headset one best values there. pink version cute offers perfect color match versizon v3 series motorola pink razr. however, believe gentle pink color stylish element headset. take away pink left generic looking earpiece.now lets talk performance. h500 couldn't eaiser use. paired daughter's verizon motorola pink razr seconds, button configuration unit makes perfect sense. buttons gentle action yet offer satisfying "click" feel pushing them; mushy feeling all. sound quality speaker quite good acceptional. voice quality microphone impressive. phone daughter, actually sounds much better headset using razr phone alone. tend pickup great deal background noise though, may best noisey environments. h500 sits stable manner daughters ear. ear hook soft flexible worn extended periods without discomfort. look feel fall ear even tipping head.i giving headset full 5 stars. rate h500 highly outstanding style, rather simple functionality, solid performance, great build quality overall value money. can't get better bluetooth headset $30.00! highly recommend headset woman looking cute color match verizon moto razr, also seeking comfortable fit impressive performance. may better looking headsets there, you'll likely suffer penalties cost and/or performance. 
 light weight simple use. charger bad agfa store sent new one fast. 
 one best purchases i've made on-line. h700 big upgrade (previously used h500). complaints whatsoever. love fact turn headset closing it. small face & small ears -- dainty piece perfect! 
 compact, stylish, comfortable. currently one headsets known work well htc mogul. wear day never run charge, sometimes even forget wearing lighweight comfortable. amazon top pricing product too. could buy two i'd pay full retail elsewhere. sound clear end receiver's end. great product great value. 
 i've spent last two weeks ordering returning bluetooth headsets. finally, going quite models (motorola h350, motorola h500, plantronics 655, nx6000), found great one. willing pay $150 headset comfortable, easy use, -- importantly -- callers didn't complain about. headset great sound quality ends, setup buttons easy use. boom folds out, headset turns on. fold back, headset turns off. several headsets tried terrible buttons -- small hard work without looking mirror. great.i really looking forward writing review tonight i'm hoping help someone else avoid research (cnet, endless googling) find one trial error.look further, you've found great headset! buy now!(and no, don't work motorola!! haha) 
 h700 replaces hs810, smaller, lighter seems work well similar battery life. cost less ! 
 ...i paired razr v3 phone. sound quality excellent, receiving sending. loud enough hear rather noisy car without problem. one i've talked complained sending sound quality all--most didn't know using headset. pairing simple worked according instructions.the headset fits well, doesn't problem glasses, isn't particularly noticable i'm wearing it. buttons logical work well.the charger razr charger (same voltage/current connector), two chargers used either device...and charge headset using car charger got razr. handy! think charger compatability seal deal razr users--in opinion, definitely bluetooth headset get razr.the negative manual, like manual razr phone, imcomplete. instance, although container says pair eight devices, could figure pair additional devices, switch devices. wish motorola would invest writing production proper manuals--or least make full manual accessible web, don't want clutter manual people features folks won't use.oh...and i'd also like able wear thing without put standby mode...but given little energy standby mode uses, that's really big deal. perhaps motorola made microphone boom switch always switch headset off, switch unless press big button, least option. 
 h500 stoped working went get h700 like much better. sound quality good better h500 h700 better features h500 would listen mp3 sounds razor would much better 
 recently purchased razr v3. tried several headsets without luck.hs805 uses battery, best soundhs815 - okh300 - poor - low volumem500 - poor - lower 300, beepshs850 - good design, poor volume (again, low) highest setting, constantly beepsplantronics 640 - joke, falls apart hand. little pieces everywhere.the h700 - finally good quality headset! callers problems hearing me... problem hearing road. quiet car, always found pressing headset ear order hear conversations. case h700. thing volume galore! fact, bump ticks, works great highway speeds. it's comfortable... (unbelievably light) think 850 small.... 700 truly 30% smaller moto claims. closed, thing hide behind .50 cent piece. buttons easy operate feel. anyone uses headset regularly knows adjusting opposing buttons challenging - h700. place top bottom rest finger need adjust easily. pairing setup took 1 minute. sound crystal clear. thing bells whistles. works promised right box. 4 stars design operation. one plug home car fits all, 5 stars top notch product. 
 purchased bluetooth headset two main reasons. first, uses charger motorola razr rim blackberry 8700c. secondly device easily turns time extend microphone.i've used 1/2 dozen bluetooth headsets one favorites.here summarized pros cons:pros:-uses charger motorola razr phones-open/close microphone turn headset on/off-small, lightweight easy put (one handed eve)cons:-only connects one bt device time. razr blackberry carry everywhere. two devices cannot h700 connect simultaneously (other bluetooth products - notably plantronics) able connect simultaneously two devices.i recommend headset, amazon competitive pricing available. easily beating even discount superstores i'd seen 50% more. 
 imho slightly better moto hs850. it's smaller, lighter. boom smaller. that's issue, equal imho.now problem people cannot hear you, sound muffled away phone. wearing bluetooth, look mirror see boom touches cheek beard it'll touch that. note small hole inside boom gets sound. anything touches impede voice....it's like putting towel regular phone talking someone. need puffy cheeks problem happen. unless narrow face, chances happen you'll blame bluetooth!to fix this, get either neoprene tubing sticky foam one end (mole skin) cut small piece put hinge near boom smaller piece (if needed) top other. make space cheek boom people hear you! still able close boom. 
 recently dropped land line went 100% wireless telephone service; change, wanted make sure didn't suffer numb arm talking smaller cell phone longer periods wanted use hands-free approach. previous experiences satisfying back day earbuds dangling wires. but, new cellphone came bluetooth wireless capability, opened new world options.i played number store, didn't get real world experience them. but, really liked design feel h700. research - much reviews amazon; left bit skeptical many unfavorable reviews written - mentioned negatives like poor sound quality, minimum range, bluetooth connective problems name few. but, decided side review read positive reviews amazon.the bottom line happy h700. experienced absolutely problems - people talked hear fine, hear them; h700 7 feet phone reception problems; h700 easy setup phone (lg vx8300) immediately connects whenever turn device on.feature-wise, h700 great! buttons easy use understand flip mic great idea...the phone rings, flip open (keep closed conserve power) call answered immediately; flip closed end call powers well. h700 also features button answering ending calls don't want power unit.i highly recommend motorola h700 bluetooth headset choose - yet find negative it.

 owned item least five years, don't believe i've never reviewed it. one first bluetooth headphones come still believe one best. couple things would consider cons. 1. headphones really heavy ears. becomes painful while. 2. buttons really sensitive. accidentally called hung many people it's ridiculous. hand, love ability listen mp3 player use phone headset. told many people sound incredible compared bluetooth headphones. bass wonderful people hear clearly make call. picks background noise good, however. tried headphones keep coming back these. are, far, best pair owned. 
 reading reviews favorable, pleasantly surprised headset taking advantage really good deal recently. sound quality excellent really impressive bass response. pairing lg vx8700 perhaps makes difference. minor issues though. placing phones properly head mean comfortable time, eventually 2 hours seem pinch. even unbearable. cycled them, music stops answer resumes. jogged them, ear pieces pop rinse necessary. occasionally either phone headset gets confused trying something fast. flipping songs, re-pair device. sound quality pretty good microphone considering distance. slightly muffled, still clear enough limiting factor. cool feature tap right ear piece opens music player phone starts playing. jabra consider putting locking button appropriate location easy inadvertently push one many buttons taking adjusting phones. eventually learn handle avoid this, quirky. would recommend headset looking something pair one newer phones support a2d bluetooth. excellent cycling!update 8/22/07 headset continues operate great, despite dropped numerous times. side note, found riding today pairing lg vx 8700 fouled music intermittent. occasional stumble otherwise smooth streaming, different. ended removing device 8700 re-pairing it. fixed. thing think recently unplugged phone docked usb mode pc supposed without ending via menu first.i use headset run found little floss go along way. yep, tied bit floss ear pieces leaving one side simple knot. floss position across top head pulled ear pieces plastic pieces normally end pinching tops ears tops. double knotted simple knot voila, floss helps support headset running pinching noted original review reduced greatly. actually sitting typing listening petty. great stuff... 
 jabra nothing wrong these. solidly build beautifully designed. paired easily every device i've tried, even work well hands free headset bluetooth cell phone. however, don't work mac, contrary insinuation reviewer, way jabra's fault. bluetooth bluetooth, it's computer manufacturer support "profiles" supported various devices. case mac, apple's bluetooth support incomplete; don't handle advanced audio profile required stereo headsets, headset (or stereo bluetooth headset, matter) work mac apple decides fix this. completely jabra's control, well engineered device. window's xp computer, work well.the negative find headset adjustable thus may fit everybody comfortably. (my wife, example, can't get sit well.) 
 purchased minimal expectations quite impressed. using cell phone sound quality superb. also, using phone calls quite convenient. microphone great sound quality top-notch. even music playing get call automatically pauses music phone call resumes call finished. battery life way longer expected; owned couple months charge twice. buttons headset quite convenient well. would say downside tad bulky somewhat resembling earmuffs. also, depending head size may may fit you; fortunately say fit discomfort stay head even gym. great product! 
 read reviews awesome phone is. but, want bluetooth headset go along it, get plantronics voyager 510. i've tried motorola hs850 h500 & logitech bt headset significant static. i've searched google found people problem phone multiple types headsets. go plantronics voyager 510. little static leave phone one room walk another slight (almost negligable) increase static. problem "answer" button headset answer phone won't automatically connect headset. must first answer phone pushing green button phone press "answer" button headset. . .afterwards, connection seamless. minor inconvenience luxury wireless bt virtually static-free. don't take word it. buy voyager 510 local store easily return you're happy.mp3 ringtones!!!!this phone great making mp3 ringtones. however, change file extension ".mp3" ".3gp". transfering ".3gp" files phone sinch free usb cable pc software. and, want edit mp3 play chorus song ringtone, samsung gives software too!!!! it's included pc studio software comes phone. don't forget change extension ".3gp" . phone allow play mp3 songs (like ipod) won't allow make mp3 songs ringtones unless pay downloading website like t-mobile. . . or, method mentioned above. changing extension 3gp also easy program show full name music file (i.e. check_up_on_it.mp3), like nero burning rom. 
 motorola floundering cell phone market came razr. worldwide, made fashion technological statement, catapulted manufacturer dismal afterthought leader cell phone market. released candy bar equivalent (slvr), improved razr's lines stylish clamshell pebl. review motorola pebl.after using pebl days, first thing impressed sound quality. recently, played sony/ericson, palmone, nokia samsung phones, must say motorola sounds best. first all, volume earpiece loud enough hear walking busy new york city street, cars, trucks buses creating deafening noise. second, volume control button well placed allow easily adjust level. third, best all, phone intelligent enough filter much loud background noise, person you're speaking hear without struggling make you're saying. found nokia good too, palm, samsung sony/ericson phones don't well all, sony ironically back pack. also noteworthy speakerphone. it's loud office phone's speaker, plenty loud, example, participate conference call driving. background noise reduction virtues phone, impressed. also, voice recognition - based solely spelling contacts, phone recognize you're saying able voice-dial.it may seem odd make fuss sound quality age smart phones, designer recently explained me: form follow function. let pebl first foremost good phone. add bells whistles later. attention principle earned pebl five stars me.a note carriers: gsm worldwide, use phone overseas well usa. however, limits states tmobile cingular. used both, feel tmobile sounds better, cingular better coverage. it's tradeoff. carriers offer 7 14 day "trial" period test network's performance. recommend use trial, don't hesitate bounce back forth keeping number.i four major pros pebl:1. motorola pioneering cell phone market making latest models "quad-band" gsm, means phone work well usa (850/1900 mhz) well rest world (900/1800 mhz). gsm phones tri-band (850/1800/1900) they'll work great here, performance abroad touch go, phone performing poorly indoors. none others (nokia, ericson, samsung etc.) offer quad-band gsm standard, motorola's recent offerings, could find quad-band phones massive pda smart phones.2. battery life: cell phones give estimates standby time talk time. realistic factor long thing last charges average person? answer: 3 4 days. moderate use (about 10 calls day, totaling 30 45 minutes), needed charge phone 3rd day.3. usb port: phone's connection world via standard mini-usb port. charger fits this, plug computer standard usb mini-usb cable. cable connects digital cameras certain mp3 players (at least ones don't use overpriced proprietary cables). chances already one cables plug pc, two things happen: phone start charge usb, pc detect new device. download drivers motorola (if didn't get cd phone). addition phone drivers, "phone tools" application lets synchronize contact list calendar outlook, simply backup phone's contents. synchronize photos, ringtones sms messages well. here's best part: phone also modem. make sure data plan connecting internet, longer need hot spot. gprs give little 2x speed dialup, edge take 4x.4. phone alarm built in. fact several, name them, turn phone night, alarm still work, ask want turn phone silence it.other noteworthy items: screen good, camera produces reasonable images videos, enough memory snap 100 shots phone's highest resolution. nice touch.and now, three cons:1. longest time, cared much motorola contact management interface. nearly phones allow multiple numbers / addresses per contact, motorola hasn't caught yet. contact multiple phone numbers, contact exist multiple times. makes dialing slower motorola phones you'll scroll longer contact list; searching numbers nearly intuitive nokia phone brands.2. phone allows assign custom ring tones certain members address book; however, contacts custom ringtone, phone doesn't differentiate calls text messages, contact custom tone sends text, phone might play entire minute-long song rather quick beep beep, annoying middle night. avoid using custom contact/ring tone assignments you'll avoid problem.3. shiny dialing surface screen pick grease face require regular cleaning want avoid phone looking "icky".in conclusion, happily surprised pebl. sexy phone, sounds great. perfect phone audiophile, person wants device works without cope secondary bells whistles phones days. historically, motorola known producing good hardware - virtue clearly stated pebl. intend use fancy features modern cell phones (sms, mms, etc) - words plan use software features, expect less intuitive brands phones. much motorola known producing excellent hardware, menus navigation bewildering times. think get folks designed hardware redesign software interface. then, moto range would dominate. end, it's good phone, it's solid, it's small light enough fit comfortablty pocket, works. 
 phone two months best one owned,i three razr's many called cutting edge phones even v3i none good this,as pebl simple open unless butter fingered fool,and finish wearing keypad well mine fine.the phone made better flimsey razr is,you want quality phone works well looks get phone,you want cheap made buy something else. 
 purchased phone use europe recent trip. loved it. nice form factor, opening requires one hand voice quality great. happy purchase. wish us carrier (verizon) phone! 
 best phone ever owned. reception good, battery life good, ring audible, quality voice good. mine already came ear phone, usb cable, leather case 256mb memory card. things good: - need clean cover frequently (it gets easily smudged); - mp3 sound perfect (well phone mp3 player); - switched gsm card reverted kanji characters hard time find english option ;) 
 really enjoy high quality, that's constant belkin. product reputation repeats, holds up. 
 received item time good condition. retractable cables like one better ones used. perfect storing vehicle charging. mess glove compartment. 
 works advertised cord, normally way, get tangled. genius solution. didn't someone earlier? 
 and, great price too. product works exactly factory cord; and, retractable feature allows easily keep one stored truck instead toting cords back forth house truck. 
 given reviews here, decided getting two batteries would smart due freshness issue, case first one didn't last long. (my original battery worn out.) it's couple months first battery still going strong needed charger finish calls. price major factor compared retail wanted wait months considering new phone. much lower price made plan easier, giving plenty time consider next generation razr. batteries quickly died short-term didn't lose much deal. 
 battery exactly advertised, genuine motorola br50 battery. knock off. such, works exactly way would expect motorola battery work, much less money. 
 we've using 2 batteries ten days problems all. new appearance charge phones 12 hours prior first use. follow review - it's 2 full months since bought batteries still working perfectly. 
 batteries exactly advertised, delivered normal timeframe, issues hiccups drama vendor. "slam, bam, thank you, sirs madams." battery life really subjective everyone's "normal" different. life definitely restored compared original 2 year old battery. experience use bluetooth really drains batteries quickly. that's bluetooth issue goes away don't use bluetooth. complaints product. 
 fits razr like original battery made motorola. worked perfectly second battery days much effort find charger. 
 razr v3 two years wouldn't hold charge. cingular & verizon stores offered replacements batteries cost almost much phone new. $10 bucks replacement gave phone new lease life. exact replacement knockoff. great talk standby time. 
 battery goes 5 year old cell phone available local stores. price right using month w/o problems... 
 looks good easy pair. fits nicely looked described ad, shipping right money. 
 case almost perfect palm treo 700. fit great. leather soft high quality. magnetic closure best i've seen, alignment required yet secure. one exception belt clip. takes three men dog get belt! tight think could tear case getting unless pry something like pen. don't know thinking putting tight clip great case. 
 die hard treo 600 user. best case i've ever owned. already wore exact case 3 year period bought another one. perfect fit antenna treo 600 650. 
 palm oem version fits great looks good. 3 months, issues all. also two small pockets sd cards noted ad. great value, 40% less palm selling for. 
 spent good bit time reading amazon reviews treo cases. cases mixed reviews. palm one treo 700/650 pouch leather case stylish nice soft leather. first treo moved around little case. little movement noticable bothersome. remembered little pocket inside case, put 4 business cards inside. enough keep treo moving. actually pocket can't really hold 4 5 business cards without making difficult close treo case. really like magnetic flap. it's easy open close. finally belt clip holds securely belt. 
 happy headset - thank you!i don't problems complaints. h700 nice upgrade h500. 
 wont find better choice time. switch folding headset easy push buttons make difference world. don't believe me, purchase jabra one headsets, place pocket purse answer call phone. chances forgotten turn unit caller live wherever left bluetooth headset within 30 feet. h700 folds take ear folds, turns off. sounds good reasonably priced effective, simple !! 
 it's lite, comfortable, sound good one i've talked commented phone sounds different. however problem getting pair. go online figure since directions came poor. could get light stop blinking blue purple pair. online directions said close mic, hold button turns purple open mic. that's really correct either. open mic finger holding button down. forgot mention important step. can't tell many times figuring one out. said works well pairing easy getting light turn purple. obviously 5 stars gave i'm recommending it.update: february 11, 2009 bluetooth slowly died. people longer able hear me. said sounded like miles away. took good car unit, always kept case worn maybe two hours day average. tried cleaning mic didn't help. lasted year half guess got moneys worth. thought you'd like know. 
 i've paired mine razr v3 black razr v3i without issues. sound perfect, static interference. callers end hear clearly vice versa. lightweight portable cannot recommend enough!the thing want mention purchased back, getting started guide outdated gave older sequence steps pairing device, frustrating beginning realized instructions wrong. went online motorola got proper set instructions, voila, perfect!

 like convenience blue tooth wireless, family keeps coming back top quality wired headset sound quality. use much wear out, use periodically travel mobile phones, also portable home phones. know going wind use headset instead wireless - comparison use plantronics voyager pro plus great wireless headset, real sound quality ends can't beat plantronics mx500 series. hope keep around while. 
 (broke them, totally fault) use adapter android phone. sensitive clients calls press people hearing clearly, easily consistently. take headset sister 3-in-1 version day several bluetooth headsets purchased years. know older product, works extremely well. made titanium, would buy almost price trashed (again, fault, dog ate one, crushed other) two them. thankfully inexpensive. 
 bought plantronics bluetooth headsetplantronics voyager 510 bluetooth headsetfor car extremely happy it. wanted leave car, though, knew took got out, would never remember put back car. decided get wired headset keep briefcase because, despite technically literate, i'm still leary something emitting radio waves stuck ear day. mx505 great. importantly, it's durable. also good sound quality people call trouble hearing me. 
 c139 cheapest model tracfone's lineup. it's good basic phone gives good voice clarity easy text messaging. tracfone doesn't lot services offer (which isn't bad thing people want basic cellular service), phone doesn't give music downloads live tv (which carriers mostly misleading hype anyway). color screen small good-quality. thing don't like tracfone's 60-day refill polic: must refill every 60 days keep account active; otherwise forfeit number balance. prepaid providers like speak wireless (from 7-eleven) give one full year usage. 
 bought phone sick sprint's contracts. great following reasons:- cheap ($13)- superb coverage: travel coast coast even get service backwoods rural alabama (costa rica too)- battery lasts lasts (and lasts)- easy useall wanted phone worked. previously owning $700 mini-computer type phone ready kick 'em curb great. you're tired high charges contract hassles, give try. spent $100 1200 minutes year's worth service.the caveat service get dinged entire minute even used 2 seconds it. good stuff have, little detail doesn't bother bit! 
 great product. works like name brand product. haven't problem product. price allot better name brand one. pay name product like this. would recommend product everyone.

 used go water park. didnt swimming walked lot sprinklers. phone fine could use touch screen case. 
 wish backside clear could access camera phone. otherwise says. 
 it's job well. smart phone fits & use plastic. took fishing & worked like charm. think it's well worth money. 
 i've fallen water kayaking times ipod touch lg xenon cases. they've submerged water minutes survived. haven't issues humidity inside pack, i'm heavy user cell phone touch paddling. 
 important drop remote control lake due high cost replacement. case exactly right size since clear front remote operated without opening case winner 
 good practice bag, regular quality, work well, price, product company offer satisfaction purchase 
 fishing i'd used identical &#34;brand name&#34; dry pak loaned friend. kwik tek is, said identical, good bit cheaper. waterproof mudproof protection iphone i've used fishing working outside damp, muddy conditions. padding provides additional protection drops bumps. float devices, especially leave air inside. except camera, phone apps fully functional although prefer remove talking. lanyard provides bit extra security haven't yet needed kayaking. uses assure inside totally dry, good idea prop open air drop one silica packs. guess could get protection baggie, low price kwik tek cheap insurance phone priceless data. 
 buying $400 cell phone pocket wasn't going take chances it. pouch saved phone's life! attached pouch mountain bike large rubberized bands (made purpose) stretch wrap around bars loops end stretch around phone.i unexpectedly sank tipped small stream phone bike became caked mud. washed case river phone fine inside. pouch become coveted fellow mountain bikers without protection... phones. 
 tried ordering blackberry battery line turned fake knockoff. fake knockoff. works great. 
 made decision early year pick newblackberry curve 8330as better method communicating clients family. seen reviews averaged 4.4 5, seemed decent choice. turned one best decisions made year, blackberry turned far better expected... faster previous phone, reliable, versatile rugged, dropped calls. phone one simple problem: it's battery eater!went cell phone provider see getting extra battery, surprised find standard 1000 mah oem lithium ion battery cost almost $45.00. seemed bit steep, began searching amazon.com found blackberry li-ion [oem] c-s2 battery. cautious extreme price difference, figured truly oem c-s2 battery, worth gamble.examined arrived, found original blackberry logo, marked c-s2 face, correct version phone (and many blackberry models). back listed lithium ion battery, 3.7v, capacity 1150mah 4.3wh... identical original battery. charged overnight, done phone first received original battery.it good choice, battery perfect backup original. function original c-s2 battery, seems difference. went buy second backup, seemed good idea "better safe sorry" situations. must admit use built-in gps quite bit, along frequent 'net access, probably accounts need extra battery power. might note picked anexternal battery charger blackberry 8300 8320 8330, perfect compliment batteries.one might note prices blackberry c-s2 oem batteries seem vary quite bit here, seem come well $7.00... far less cell phone retailers charging. searching amazon.com you'll find excellent prices these.if battery seems last long original specs blackberry stated, argue retailer... waste far less time get one c-s2 oem batteries here. giving 5-star rating without hesitation all. 
 great battery super price. cannot compare higher rated &lt;life> batteries. works great original spec. get days worth use easy. keep charged. 
 battery perfect blackberry 8700, long standby time quick charge, eforcity's delivery speedy too. 
 price good cable working well. good experience cable. 
 single glitch. fair priced fast shipping. problems hassles connecting syncing using windows xp vista. what's love? 
 like tablet case keyboard wire keyboard sticking case. easy way get caught something damage. works great keep wire keyboard inside area case protected. 
 exactly it's supposed do: allow plug mini-usb plug place couldn't fit angle. 
 device small attachment navigon 2100, 5100 7100 series gps.for reason, navigon decided place charger receptacle bottom (facing downwards) units. makes little difference use windshield suction cup hold display unit. however, use adhesive disc dash charger cord likely bent right angles make connection, receptacle gps points straight down. device, attached gps, allows allows charger cord come side, eliminating acute bending cord.conclusion:a helpful device navigon gps units; intend users wish unit mounted dash. 5 stars 
 using keep garmin nuvi 360 powered driving. didn't know got it, garmin plugged using battery power, automatically turns car turned (that's get reading instruction manual, lol).to cleaner appearance car, mini-usb plugged ball mount holding gps plugged gps itself. unfortunately, port really close ball mount restricts it's movement plugged in. adapter, makes cable less intrusive makes gps free adjust ball mount nearly position desired. combination 1.50 mini-usb cable, probably cheapest way keep nuvi charged driving!! 
 needed, run cord gps mounted car. trigger garmin go usb pc-connected mode, like usb right angle cords do. 
 thought help good look two devices important last need modify mini usb easy cable one small pcb inside giving room add resistor. thank seller. 
 love able use phone mp3 player. neat hear person talking stereo. love product. well worth money. 
 think pretty good headphones compared older set logitech bluetooth headphones. ones much comfortable longer time don't seem fragile. love there's built-in microphone voice. i've used phone people may give strange looks talking person phone seemed hear fine.i think also great use cable often gets way. enjoy using i'm taking bike ride. adapter ipod use these. complaint go gym on. hear music fine volume up, however i'm watching show ipod often times can't hear much dialogue. situations end using ear buds. i'd say sound quality alright. i'm audiophile usually good ear sound quality. battery life seems good like charge standard mini-usb connection.i've 1 problem that's probably worth sharing. pairing headphones different devices sometimes issue wouldn't pair anything. i'd shut off, plug pc powered on. seconds i'd disconnect tried pair would work. sure cause didn't try plugging regular power source see fixes it. warning come across problem too. doesn't happen every time isn't deal breaker me. 
 love it, bought at&t store first came almost $140.00, see great price here. pairs easily excellent sound quality (and i'm extremely picky comes quality sound). want buy extra set case anything ever happens these. charge fast work great. problem ever without case, accidently turn way easy need them, battery dead. button right ear pushes easy turn unit expecially handle move them. always sure light blinking you'll drain battery, whose charging connector comes standard small usb connector found phones headsets today. comes charger black protective cover bit small, fighting get bag cause accidently turn on. 
 best headset every had. comfort great clarity. fact comes much makes unlike other. normally purchase accessories came it. opinion, it's best buy. 
 headset exactly described manufacturer. sound great. fit comfortable; 2-3 hours without even realizing it's on.you can't go wrong this.

 use transmitter back tv bluetooth headphones. works perfectly purpose battery lasts pretty long, given size thing. it's really small, smaller matchbox even. charges 2 hours go couple weeks, hour two use per day. problems trying get thing pair, it's looks buttons, don't worry, it's there. light also button, opposite side usb charging port, audio cable. play thing little make pro it. you'll problems. definitely recommend little transmitter.

 far best headset i've used. performance & comfort, i've found anything better yet. you're looking current motorola headsets, stop look further. unit worked equally well moto q & samsung u740.pros:1. ear design(no hook) - always hated wear hook ear gets way wear sunglasses2. like fact hard case protection use doubles charger base.3. probably one smallest lightest i've use.cons:1. haven't really found yet.** make sure don't buy fake ones ebay/else where. tax/shipping, amazon price still one best price there.

 without doubt _loudest_ bluetooth headset i've ever used. even friend mine mumbles constantly phone i've never use 50% volume. i've tried four different phones work great them. sound quality top notch too.tip:try different tips, try ears. 
 bluetooth headset tiny compared others i've researched. purchased daughter, loves it. paired easily env2 verizon phone. called test could hear clearly reports hear well too. feedback noise echo. reports comfortable, wearing long periods time without problem. standby time 70 hours, doesn't constantly charging. great product. 
 expected small earphone based reviews still surprised it's tiny size first looking close.medium ear "hook" worked - suggest playing (removing rubber hook adjusting ear piece) getting right fit - bud goes ear added loop rubber supposed counter curve another part outer ear - genius design imho thing in, even jumping shaking head tapping head (yes tried too, silly know...) dislodge this.paired easily samsung ach930, sound great side call also impressed, complaints echo static.have plantronics 510 good, wep200 smaller yet compares quality plantronics. 
 love clear sounds crazy like everyone else hook deal price seen sprint 49.95 deal!clear static thing problem volume put people mute ( prob bluetooth) 
 $20 paid it, satisfied. size great barely noticeable ear. battery life also great. 
 say get great product steal price ($5 assuming get $20 mail rebate). voice quality good, connectivity easy well. product delivers it's intended for. 
 first thing noticed samsung wep200 first connected treo 750 fast connected great quality was.i owned many bluetooth headsets unusable static would connect device timely fashion even connect unit standby long periods time.the wep200 connects quickly sound quality superb.people end can't even tell bluetooth headset.the earpiece fits ear snugly fairly comfortable hours gets bit sore side. wish sort necklace dongle could placed taken needed.its small light range excellent.very highly recommended.

 small, cute clip could hurt someone with. yes, h500 headset fits well retaining strap velcro make sure stays there.motorola blt-04 bluetooth headset carrying case 
 absolutely best essential accessory bluetooth wireless headset. love death!!! thanks amazon. 
 basic thrills case bluetooth headset. imho need something put bluetooth into, is. stretches out, front back hard, elastic holds sides together velcro close top stretches over. back metal clamp clip onto belt such. 
 great idea! cases phones one bluetooth. motorola hs850 earpiece wanted make sure would lose misplace it. holder clips car visor purse handy. fits earpiece perfectly. got one husband brother bluetooth. can't beat quality price. definitely recommend anyone earpiece constantly misplacing it. 
 second blutooth earpiece ever owned. never feels like fall ear doesn't hurt wear several hours.the sound clear one end ever heard echo feed back. use lg chocolate cellphone. would buy gift others. price right great value. 
 sounds good end.took long time earpiece soften maybe ear confored it.buggy. reset while. 1st call sometimes dumps.good noise control transmit. steady noise eliminated music voices still cause interference. use 18 wheller. one bluetooth used there. few. thats put bugyness. 
 11th different bluetooth headset i've tried past year it's best, far, ones i've tried. best could be....not long shot works goes long way.i use business calls yet called it. within self makes winner gennum nxzen almost works good. difference hear one relative ease opposed nxzen. boost microphone (on nxzen)gain decreases audio issue. prefer "in-the-ear" type headset i'm always using loud places like airports etc. built boom slides forward provides excellent audio receiver. still, struggle times, hearing caller. talk time, far, good. wear several hours point ear start hurting.i use treo 700w. drops pairing semi-regular basis. easy pair original phone i've able pair thing.overall, waiting wait more. it's worth price. 
 nice stylist product. using treo 700p. crystal clear sound quality different volument levels suit (use hearing aids). long lasting battery time. charge weekends only.cons: occasional loss bluetooth communication phone headset. 
 it's years since bluetooth headset, many i've used, far favorite. could listen streaming music phone stayed ear really well. headset i've people could actually hear time. sliding boom mic made big difference.the downfall model, reviewers also written, rubber tips hold headset ear break time. used superglue prolonged life mine while, annoying. 
 nice looking piece works well. voice quality excellent, people i've called report sometimes slight buzzing talking them, although still hear well. battery life excellent charges fast. comfortable lightweight, glad didn't pay more, one fine everyday casual use.

 bought expensive outter case get one surprised one feels better galaxy note. course would recommend, specially doesn't want expend lot money case. 
 reviews stating.....this excellent case note! openings exactly right, easy turn screen button upper right phone, stylus comes easy, able charge use cameras. one reviewer stated secure screen protector - case enough over-lap secure. screen touch surface. boxwave shipped arrived time excellent condition. 
 item described. saved phone knocked bath 6 yo son. attractive good purchase. would order again.recommended. 
 case pretty slim yet protects phone elements. also case great phone turned screen side screen actually hit surface case lip extends past, feature like. it's ease peace mind know equipment well protected. 
 fits well at&t galaxy note. holes might little microphone big deal. dropped phone gave cushion fall. thank god.. 
 got international galaxy note n7000 fits great. would recommend buying screen protector well. works great protect phone looks great well.my phone white makes case look like lighter blue, think it's really pretty color love it. it's see put fortunes fortune cookies show back fun.but warned product picture "blue" galaxy note phone, white one case appear lighter color. 
 got case bought gnote must say looked sexy great! got leather case replace it! price quality great, looks even better! 
 fit verizon version samsung note ii. made classic mistake reading description. thought &#34;international version&#34; meant would fit phones nations -- dummy, me!i searched, again, cannot find fit verizon version design. may released later. hand, cover feels great hand. can't use it. 
 say, bought wife's note back. cheap fits well without added bulk. grippy sides really helped holding larger device loves most. ports open power volume buttons, though covered, function perfectly.if want simple, affordable skin protect bumps bruises without much added bulk, price large starbucks latte' can't beat one! 
 fits note perfectly. great cover protection without adding bulk phone. nice back design also. looks like quality material used. 
 purchased case note suprised nice case price. would highly recommend anyone looking nice cheap case. 
 case made firmer material silicone cases, perfect doesn't stretch get caught going pocket case. hugs phone tight enough many people won't know case it. first thought case making button use difficult, took case realized galaxy note buttons terrible even without case. it's much difficult case on, get used it. textured grip area sides nice tough well. 
 owned many phones years lot expensive cases.this far best case come across. add bulk phone pure comfort holding hand speechless. embossed sides , nice rubbery feel gives good comfort it's dust magnet.i ordered case one protect corners phone dropped. definitely keep brand mind future. it's good definitely recommend anyone wants good protection, comfort style. thank boxwave... 
 great case, fits perfect. holes align correctly buttons, mic's micro usb galaxy note. definitely recommend anyone wanting additional protection low cost. 
 great body case provide good protection adding bulk, easy put fit perfectly highly recommended. 
 like reviews, case great! really like lip it'll protect screen set way. it's flexible like gel kind, looks great. 
 i'm using case at&t version note. gets 5 stars high quality/price ratio. material soft flexible, cut-outs line ok... perfect, don't cause functionality issues. love textured hand grips sides. hard buttons require little pressure push, prefer covered open, recessed case. s-pen opening fine case, problem getting out. make note feel noticeably heavier naked phone, lot area cover note. it's perfect case, i've paid $30 cases "idevices" similar issues. boxwave shipped pretty quickly, tracking available. 
 pros:+ cheap!+ inexpensive+ works greawtcons- didn't get waste $30 piece plastic protect phonea previous discriminating iphone user.... love saving money 
 pros -- cheap- protects phone types mishaps (straight drop corner phone, walking/running phone goes unintended "slide" concrete)- increase bulk phone considerably it's relatively light weight- makes buttons difficult press less accidental presses rocker power key (some may like do)- easy remove replace (great people battery swaps instead wall/car-charging day)- increased grip reduces chance phone leave hand unintentionallycons -i don't care "wave" effect back would prefer all-matte finish opposed combination matte/gloss finishoverall, product exactly it's supposed added benefits like button protection (most cases leave buttons exposed) makes less likely accidentally press them. also, case wraps front screen protrudes 1/16" beyond glass protects screen phone accidentally slid across floor it's dropped flat glass. gripe aesthetic one that's subjective... don't think galaxy note owners critical aesthetics. hopefully company makes one soon-to-be-released note 2 i'll getting one it's released. 
 highly recommend case samsung galaxy note. international unlocked version note, fits perfectly. it's durable gives peace mind phone isn't going slip hands. love knurled edges make easy grip. case also slim, hardly know it's even there. case makes power button harder press, getting used it. 3 different style usb cables, none could seat entirely socket case (the cables would work allow connect/charge phone, bumped anything, cable would fall out). ended using dremel rotary tool slightly enlarge opening case around usb port, cables seat properly. minor quibbles, though. love case. 
 love skin, it's slim light, protects phone well! dropped already times, phone survived problems, still looks like brand new! 
 case fits great, looks good, provides good protection. sufficiently thick elastic cushion fall without making phone much bigger. style case looking for, can't get better case. phone also easy enough remove switch another case easily. 
 love it. 1 year still condition. good hand. usable &#34;standby mode&#34; plastic bracket (of course, could strong would pay it). 
 paired easily treo. sound quality perfect. one complained sound quality end, like motorolla. it's comfortable light. battery life good. totally happy it. 
 excellent product, works well, especially bt phones strong bt signal. connect next room wall good enough phone, without crackling. excellent battery quality. need small ear comfortable fit. 
 you've reviewing bluetooth headsets, you've probably heard all. don't fit ear, echo, callers can't undertand you, battery dies quickly... purchased item month ago, haven't found complaints hold true headset.i've charged once, haven't re-charge yet. sure, i've made 5 6 short calls it, it's turned least hour day commute.my wife could tell calling car, didn't notice difference normal road noise bluetooth reception.the headset fits ear comfortably. probably already read set doesn't insert ear canal, rather rests it. found comfortable, without side-effects. it's even comfortable wearing sunglasses.i've never heard echo, received complaints others hearing one.many reviewers models seem dislike multi-function button. well, it's single button, it's used perform multiple functions. sometimes press seconds, sometimes tap it. primarily use 'on' 'off'. 'on' takes 2 seconds, 'off' takes 5 6 seconds (although admit, seems take bit longer i'd prefer...) turn off. i'm sure would complain feature, phones one...i'm sure fuss reviewers (more often brands...), headset seems perfect me. 
 husband. said trouble connections know product, time using parties connection. would probably buy though design way fit. 
 overall headset one best owned, quite few. 3 different jabras, motorola, another plantronics, various brands. headset clear since fits directly ear, loud enough. pairing snap. currently using new samsung a990.the gripe, isn't really anything serious this. wear headset right ear. driving night, blinking device extremely bright. see cabin vehicle. 
 great product, cofortable easy setup. it's features wonderful battery charger included recharge device anywhere anytime. 
 plantronics world leader ear-piece peripherals. manufacture every imaginable headsets telephone gaming. explorer 330 fits bill supplement bluetooth cellphone ease use functionality way superior lot bluetooth headphones there. mine 2 years always worked great. pairing problem headset, pairing recorded phone, quirks pairing need use it. distance-wise, conform 33ft maximum, personal note, hardly part headset phone distance hardly matters according intended use. overall happy headset exceeded expectations great lengths! 
 plantronics makes best bluetooth headsets get cost. contest. made mistake purchasing jawbone, sennheiser, blueparrot, motorolla, blue trek, god knows others. plantronics brand i've purchased 1 of. many brands cost well 4 5 times one does, none compare battery life, consistency connection, around value. headset take getting used rubber boot slightly penetrates ear, days forget wearing it. headset i've found easier hear sennheiser, likes stop communicating phone til re-pair costs 6 times does.background noise suppression stereotypical, there's noise, person end likely hear translation it. mic sensitive found jawbone, something productive like washing dishes won't blow eardrum whoever speaking with, hear level noise(the jawbone brutally painful that!). think 5th maybe 6th plantronics i've bought, i'm sure won't last.on side note, battery, constant daily use, last approximately 500 charges, 1.5 years avg. typical bluetooth headsets. cost less $20, means unit cost barely $1 per month, opposed $10-15 per month designer headsets! 
 go comfort comes headsets. plantronics headset comfortable headset i've ever owned, always buy plantronics. got one sister loves too. i'm getting ready buy plantronics pro plus headset, use old plantronics back-up. 
 bought first bluetooth-enabled phone 3 years ago deal included motorola bluetooth headset. cool, thought. used less less, thing recharged home would last hour. soon thought hard use ... hard put on, totally weird turn take ear, flip mouthpiece, put back ear. whoever designed thing clue people use headsets. also sounded like talking bottom water well. whenever used conference calls people would yell go mute. started asking people waiting rooms airports brand brand liked. got many people hated jabra didn't even consider it. already didn't really care motorola, started looking nokia, seem nice clumsy, kept meeting people love plantronics. used plantronics headsets long time office, all, that's seem well. looked plantronics didn't find one jumped me, one day ran across explorer 350. good true! kidding me, $49 bucks bluetooth headset made top brand? looked closer found plantronics something unique headset. instead charge home, comes extremely cool little clip either mounts dash hooks air vent car plugs cigarette lighter. made sense! place hold headset use most, always charging, ready use second walk around rest day fully charged. us road warriors, plantronics also thoughtfully included usb charging cable trusty laptop keep headset charged sleep. buy optional ac adapter makes feel secure. built perform? built like hummer! main piece one solid chunk looks like pretty immune normal damage clunking around pocket lot coins. piece goes around ear looks like solid well, effortlessly switches ear ear slips one easy motion. first time, thing slips thought part instantly perfect position use. operation couldn't simpler. unlike motorola several switches remember sequence push in, plantronics one switch. push turn on, push turn off, push talk, push hang up, push voice dial, etc. push. want make louder quieter? push push down. no-brainer. saved performance last convinced keep it. quick charge called friend car window rolled down. friend talk time land line. said, hey, bought new bluetooth headset want see sounds you. said, cool, put i'll let know. said ... already on! said sound perfect, background noise kind sounded least good landline. one things several airport buddies told liked plantronics durable rubber earpiece fits comfortably inside ear blocks noise ... like annoying flight announcements. say sound perfect friend every call easier hear headset ever tried.pros:sound qualitysuperior constructionease usepairing - instant flawlesspricecomfortcons:none could see. earns comfortable 5 stars! 
 various brands bluetooth headsets i've purchased, plantronics products seem offer best value dollar. purchased headsets sennheiser, blueant, trek, jawbone, pioneer, sony, motorola, god knows else. plantronics brand i've repeat customer of. i've gotten sound quality $20something headset $140+ jawbone $160+ sennheiser! advice, simple, order plantronics headset, take change get new games apps fancy android handset... 
 tried way many bluetooth headsets (motorola, plantronics, io gear, logitech, jabra) found disappointing. imho, scala 700 right best bang buck. second product cardo scala - first 500, also great headset. 500 great sound ends loud enough. headsets suffer earpiece volume loud enough. also lack noise cancellation wind noise reduction headsets made useful office quiet car. scala 700 windguard technology perfect - performs much better anything else tried. 700 1/3 smaller 500 performs well every aspect. buttons controls easy use intuitive. takes little tweaking adjust headset comfortable fit, bending shaping earpiece, headset stable comfortable. price, good option. 
 bought treo 650 far i'm impressed. battery life great (about 10 hours), charges quickly, it's literally light forget you're wearing it. also appreciate addition pc usb charge cable travelling lighter. nice addition price.i've week holding well (you get padded velcro carrying case too) initial impression, honest, seemed little fragile - it's small light. i've skeptical we'll see goes return i'll modify review.pairing treo 650 fast simple. rings 1 second phone rings also. volume control unit easy use turned loud. complaints sound quality anyone - wife says sounds little like i'm speakerphone it's clear understandable.update: chance hear wife using headset finally i'm impressed - think headset keeper. there's virtually background noise. couldn't even tell driving car. absolutely amazing background noise cancellation.update #2: battery lasts forever - impressed - really forget you're wearing thing - it's small light! 
 i've tried motorola hs810 treo bluetooth headsets, far best one. problem motorola doesn't synch treo 650 100% time; treo headset poor volume (i need quiet room hear anything). cardo scala 700 great fit (it sits right ear canal), great volume (even driving windows down), synchs treo 650 time. headset i'd recommend anyone treo 650. 
 concerned ordering device, read many reviews said device cheap piece plastic didn't fit ear properly. opened packaged first put ear, thought "oh - right!"but read manual adjusting "ear loop" angling headset slightly downward, fit perfectly ear! it's snug, doesn't flop around all. fits different way traditional "ear plug" device many ways it's comfortable it's sitting outer ear canal slightly outside.so you're thinking ordering device, i'd recommend buying it. spend little time getting fit right read manual adjust ear loop makes huge difference.(functionally product paired cingular hermes 8525 phone perfectly - sound quality fine). 
 outstanding headset. best ever used. syncs perfectly treo 650. one press call button locks onto treo bluetooth operation. even use second one home 5.8 ghz cordless phones bta ii scala bluetooth adapter. 
 can't even begin tell hell i've bt headsets treo 650. pairing issues - either won't pair phone don't stay paired. volume loud enough. returned least 5 headsets came across one. sound quality maybe 8 10 volume unbelievable, coming guy doesn't best hearing. actually hear person line - time. even noisy environments. complaints people receiving end except i'm home mircowave oven running (this scramble almost bt frequencies). buttons placed well responsive.initial pairing breeze 700 connects phone flawlessly virtually every call. two weeks i've owned it, think failed connect two occasions make well 50 calls/day. compares 75% connect rate realized bt headsets.battery life 10 10. charge headset every day often talk 5-6 hours one day without recharging. amazing! claim 10 hours (which may actually achieve) i'm amazed actually make past 5 hours.the range great can't fault headset treo known incorporate substandard bt electronics phones - make range very, poor. while, phone right pocket headset left ear, slight crackling noise. it's bad though, annoying. pulling pocket immediately relieves problem.whatever do, don't attempt test buzzer feature headset ear - buzzing loud it's placed right ear. needed find lost room, prepared make room quiet locate it. relies internal speaker create buzzing sound.nice two chargers available retail packaging (one standard wall outlet adapter one usb charger). carrying case useless nice add nonetheless.i would recommend anyone treo 650. i'm sure headset rate well phones guarantee won't find better bt headset 650.
