 worked first week charge phone 20%. waste money. 
 worked great first couple weeks stopped completely.. basically small waste money. 
 works one side time. connect two cables, one side stop working also overheated burning fuses. purchased two it's problem. cheap bad quality. 
 bought 2 tried test first ... minutes charging, felt hot. pulled product smelled burnt. tried one thing. careful... one could fire hazard could potentially destroy electrical system 
 case reason peeling, isn't much left orginal skin, loved case pink favorite color wouldn't recommend specific one anyone. 
 charger lasted week ad stopped charging samsung galaxy s3. really need start making chargers better....i've thru several!!!! 
 junk!!!......this product must miss labeled. get samsung s2 phone charge oem charger. lights on, phone says charging nothing happens. sure got defective product upsetting sit car hours see phone recharge. need reliable charger, purchase product.if need car charger samsung s2, would recommend motorola vehicle power adapter. charges fast dependable. 
 plugged car worked first couple days. hasn't worked since. phone even recognize it's plugged in. 
 thing worked well actually functioned, today stopped working past 30 day return window 10 days give take.i'm guessing quality might great stopped working, knows.. waste money. 
 first, kind cheap-looking, try buy cheapest oem car charger could phone, that's forgiveable. springs side don't much force, though, constantly slipping 12v car port. cable sturdy, rubber near connector kind stiff, makes charging operating phone go bit hassle. it's held well since purchased though.update: stopped charging month. 
 received product timely manner delightful, however, gave gift embarrassed find defective item. reimbursed product would much rather product worked first time. 
 marking legit samsung product cord stop working 3 days. i'm upset inexpensive maybe spend little buy better product amazon. work worked well. 
 charger doesn't charge battery samsung galaxy s2 (i9100) properly.when connect s2, screen gets frozen cell behaves unusual (abnormal) way. 
 nutshell, oem charger. although samsung markings, doesn't seat well samsung phone. means it's either meant another market it's counterfeit. said, wouldn't buy again.~~~~~~~~~~august 17, 2013 - updatethe seller tried make amends sending three replacement chargers. using while, still garbage. charge phone fact, drains phone. must counterfeit product. samsung markings charge phone. buy product!!!! 
 2 weeks charger fell apart taking plug , strong charger would asked money wasn't even worth . 
 one came broken bottom pice snaps sides main backing inlay piece. came scuffed paint pieces click together. broken would like it. also wasn't three click pieces 
 never this, almost bought product based amazing sounding fake reviews provided shills powerbear. look positive reviews case, see none verified purchases yet every negative review, one course, verified purchase. means everyone actually bought used product thinks crap. furthermore, many reviewers posted twice product, per color. amazon allows beyond me, point. also, look profiles positive reviewers, see posted multiple positive reviews powerbear products many reviews carbon copies other. beware paid shills! 
 watch-out, positive reviews fake. even reviewed twice using name. sleazy way sell item. 
 raving friend amazon great phone cases cheap bought this. didn't even fit phone right. poorly made. 
 case fit phone; tad small. could get 3 corners case. wound buying two piece case cost $20 local store. dropped phone many times case beat s***, damage phone. good reason buy case, one.my co-worker delayed getting case could find one liked, broke display screen, making phone unusable. buy case, rubber thing. threw mine away within 5 minutes it's arrival 
 read first reviews didn't read wish cause thing work sprint galaxy s2. wish known that. 
 different size/design galaxy ii carried usa what's carried asia. i'm usa, ordered cover galaxy ii bought usa, cover didn't fit, speaker location different phone. copmared cover another galaxy ii sold asia found design different.so bought galaxy ii usa, don't buy cover outside usa 
 purchased 3 cables cheap got good reviews. don't know people getting cables work... 3 bought, 0 functioned properly palm pre! best get charge, though entire time charging computer complaining "unknown device" "could install drivers" even though works beautifully original cable. setting works "just charge"! 3 cables fails slightly differently makes believe different flaw! i've tried wife's palm pixi well used different computers failed well. look elsewhere attempting purchase cable palm device! 
 "this cable recommended device." get error message. plus really short. 
 poor manufacturing quality connector long properly fit phone. would buy this. 
 cable good, fit samsung galaxy s4. plug in, far enough hold securely. 
 got charge samsung galaxy s2 always came unplugged phone, whenever phone would moved falls even resting flat surface would eventually find way phone. buy another usb cord became frustrated 
 disappointed cheap doubt designed newer devices. also short. took long time ship. specifically purchased due ad saying samsung galaxy devices. work s4. require good charger one newer better. 
 damaged charger. recieved charger short it. wiggle cord phone charge. 
 pretty upset find one day stopped charging phone, right middle long trip. ffffffuuuuuuu... 
 pleased item got back quickly gift. however, cannot give 5 star rating product never worked. 
 phone charger works, charges phone. however, phone charging continually beeps battery low.it stop beeping charging battery reaches certain percentage.i think correct charger using phone have.now worried based reviewers battery may blow phone i'll replace too.i would recommend buying charger.the charger old blackberry works better. 
 wrong one.the male end fit iphone 4s . pulled would retract 
 bad charger work properly really bad shortage. hate it! 
 installation easy tool kit worked though plastic tools robust break tweak much. paper foil coming battery open package folding back place worked, it's phone issue. far phone charges fast life much better 2 year old battery replaced. far would recommend battery.update: 4 weeks installing battery would last 5 hours barely using iphone voice calls time extra heavy use internet anything. drained charged dead several times, made sure location services, blue tooth, apps closed... still drained. got money back bought one 1/2 price one works great! maybe got defective battery.... risk take buying 3rd party batteries. 
 seeing 2, 5 star reviews item fake users seem trash talking iphone battery sellers 5 staring pretty messed therefore appears seller type scammer. 
 battery would charge iphone. iphone shut 2 minutes powered up. throw away. 
 really poor quality tweezer bent like nothing screw drivers made cheap plastic adhesive removing tool cheap plastic get pay would recommend anyone trying perform phone surgery 
 received today doesn't charge. i'm sure used - found piece broken iphone glass contact side. 
 eargels fit earpiece fine, nice tight, far actually getting sizes comfortably fit, forget 
 got jawbone headset. many said work great. life cant figure get work short superglue even quiet hear guess work jabra designed jawbone. 
 first installed one new jawbone ii, fantastic. fit ear canal perfectly, negating need ear loop came it. unfotunately days started rejecting headset. ear pieces would stay jawbone, would longer stay firmly ear. tried washing drying thoroughly, helped hour so. sure fit problem is, turned work jawbone ii all. 
 advertised fit habra stone. not. don't know changed advertisement since aid package habra stone got it. even one piece fit. threw away 
 bought headset would comfortable...these hurt ears like one comes matter size use. wouldn't recommend anyone...don't waste money. 
 tried using sansa clip mp3 player toyota mr2. car makes lot noise case, i'm holding audio lab quality. however, product made quite audible (at low automobile speeds) click-click-click. might able tolerate that. however, also electronic whistle increasing frequency rpm engine. whistle interfered excessively intended sound player. volume coby ca-747 ok. hadn't thought would issue bought comparable maxell cassette adapter long's replace coby ca-747. volume maxell product weak, turn way up. maxell didn't go click-click-click, whistled, too. maxell coby get 1 star me. i'm trying offering philips next... 
 disspointed getting coby cassette tape work car :/ need music 
 keep short sweet -cord contains lead must handled regularly car nowhere clean hands touching thing.sound quality quickly goes downhill crackling evident 5 uses.now stuck dashboard player modular adapter broke cassette fully eject. sure husband griping entire time tries get unstuck.avoid costs!i scanned past negative reviews since product really positive reviews lot helpful votes. big mistake unstick adapter cassette player try get amazon take back. (i bought 2 clearance) 
 things confidence trick. don't thing. can't thing. believe make phone work better probably find stripes side cars make go faster too. 
 come amazon, can't really believe selling name! 
 thing waste paper, doesn't give u better reception. total rip book :-( 
 want try one? sell dollar stores. nothing improve signal. 
 didn't work, work all. dead spot drive work, totally lose signal. device help all. waste money it. even less $2.00, worth anything. 
 cant say works tryit long time iphone didnt made difference all... 
 contrary site t-mobile lead believe, t-mobile could provide coverage home address. stop amazon.com selling phone, t-mobile transferring existing (working) at&amp;t number service (of course, took two weeks &gt; 10 phone calls).after receiving reception, called t-mobile informed actually cover area.i called at&amp;t back, happily attempted restore account, find t-mobile refused release numbers.after month essentially coverage anyone, phones happily back at&amp;t belong.the bad news t-mobile sent bill double quoted monthly rate amazon.com refunded purchase price.even areas could get coverage, phone work well. pressing keys, screen would lock needed remove battery reset it.last warning: watch charges inbound messages--if really dislike t-mobile subscriber, send lots text messages (free site)--the subscriber pay $0.05/message. 
 doesn't fit phone must return it. hassle! that's say! 
 ordered based rave reviews saw it. using treo 600 barely hear anything ear piece, even spongy covering removed. 
 item useless. plug far small fit phone, despite description fit "lg phones". dare doesn't fit. dare uses standard jack thing 2.5 mm whatever. uses tiny plug? i've never seen size cell phone! get pay for. item joke. 
 importantly, point thing goes ear cheap, thin little foam pad wear quickly. mine arrived, little pieces inside plastic bag shipped in. box, packing - even cheap bubble wrap rubber band, chucked bag. realize it's super cheap last month. now? wish amazon would be... selective offer sale. 
 sound fine headset, however mic work all.waste money worth returning. 
 earpiece stamped "verizon" different finish pictured. packing slip enclosed usps envelope came showed, "accstop" oxnard, ca. $2.47, guess doesn't matter still, item pictured. also came little plastic baggie - represented new.cannot try 3.5mm adapter hasn't arrived item earpiece set purchase. 
 purchased 4 different jabra headsets, comfortable easy hear with, poor microphone quality. thought would try model, mx150 flexible boom. again, sound quality crap. make living phone, others able hear important.i ended getting ge tl26593 earset microphone jasco worked best far. 
 phone ugly heavy terrible user interface even techies like myself. also drops calls like crazy manhattan. moto v600 much better phone, takes better pictures, gives better clarity reception, smaller, much, much cheaper. get moto v600 want t-mobile. stay away ugly monster. 
 recently moved phoenix, arizona, thought good time get new mobile phone. friend recommended nextel, saying we'd use direct connect function. cool. ordered i730 amazon. charging activating waiting required day, called get phone number. palo alto, ca, number!? that's 700 miles away! 11 hour drive next state. way close local number. nextel seem understand care. &quot;it's closest have.&quot; &quot;there 602 area code phone numbers left.&quot; begged maybe 480 number anything local call phoenix. nothing doing. days calls nextel went nowhere, called sprint (who customer service stars past) within four minutes local 602 phoenix number working current sprint phone. canceled nextel service. charging $35 (expected) plus $11.53 taxes, fees assessments &quot;we can't change&quot; couple days called customer service.if buy phone, hope nextel local area code you, don't stuck $46.53 amazon return. pretty color screen though . . . 
 it's nice-looking product. seems like would liked it. but...my unit electrical problem. connected two portable external hard drives, one powered external hard drive, printer, external dvd+-rw drive, mouse keyboard. plugged in.first noticed mouse didn't work. unplugged plugged another one. "that's strange, one doesn't work either," thought. "hmmm, what's smell?" turns out, smell hard drive frying. figured unplugged everything waited.after hours, figured everything would cooled down, started testing devices. one portable external drive still "sort of" works. see file structure copying attempts fail. powered external hard drive mostly worked couple days quit. one portable hard drive never worked again. optical drive still works, occasionally, typically won't boot. occasionally printer works. mice never worked again. keyboard fine. everything's tested 3 different pc systems 1 linux system.the worst part? redundant data storage. lost everything. 
 one, product built cheap. means overtime ports simply stop working...why? i'm really sure...perhaps cheap components, slight bending?secondly, support charging, yet time. plug say apple device you'll get error, charge make sense.this 3.0 usb hub, it's 2.0. many new devices require 3.0 near future. instance, new webcam hates plugged hub performance greatly drops.lastly: mine destroyed, slight drink mishap. nothing seems wrong device than...it stops working time time, sometimes clean ports small amount water get work again..just annoying.- additional notes: stand horrible. won't stay on, especially multiple cords attached pull various directions like power cable. (it falls easily, snap on, it's basically slightly heavy stand "rests" top of. (useless)- glows neon blue. why? i'm sure. like matches setup, it's bright, i'd rather "power" used towards devices.finally: device likely support 7 devices plugged time....i would get 3-4 work...maybe.... given point. eventually two bottom ports simply decided "not work" entirely completely stupid rarely ever used ports begin with. also made think something wrong device, wasted time trouble shooting. (just switch ports) words...don't buy device...get cheaper hub slots, 3.0 hub features.this cheap... 
 tried old bluetrek loved died. actually, killed forgot sat it. impressed advertised battery life, took plunge. shouldn't have. supposed work range 33 feet, found merely put phone opposite side body, connection gets fickle. get lots staticy noise phone 2 feet earpiece direct line sight. sort defeats purpose bluetooth technology, doesn't it? static end; girlfriend complained really even heard it. yo get this, prepared anger party line. plus side, sound nice loud th speaker. that's it. try something else, like bluetrek motorola something. trying motorola next. thing trash. 
 amazon continues ship antenna wilson electronics sleek booster, right antenna. wilson told many times shipping wrong antenna continue it. frustrating caused lot grief able get internet week due amazon's problem. returning whole package amazon even though wilson electronics able send adapter next week so, primary reason purchased product use holidays place staying little reception. able use smartphone hot spot really made angry. excuse amazon told many times wilson electronics sending customers wrong product. 
 claim works sprint pcs got one virgin mobile mc760 won't pick signal! fact actually makes signal weaker! put mc760 window get decent signal thought putting antenna roof would better plug mc760 signal strength goes down! tried connecting spectrum analyzer check doesn't get signals compared another cellphone antenna receive. tried emailing wilson weren't help. another problem cheaply made adapter connects proprietary fme connector antenna cable plugs mc760. try 3 got one would work. first one bad threads wouldn't go way, second one loose center pin pushed back tried connect it. third one finally fit correctly still signal. don't see wilson get away selling worthless junk antennas like this, must get lot consumer fraud complaints. i'm sending useless antenna back refund.i purchased wilson 301101 trucker antenna, mounted magnetic base cb antenna stuck roof works great. one must defective. 
 headset piece junk right box. nothing problems threw away first day. 
 pad extremely unreliable stick dash poorly made. one thing say wallet phone fallen pad. unfortunately, pad moves around. 
 even though package description stated adhesive, certainly white backing remove place dash . felt item thin, touch sticky all. groves competing products part faced supposed attract "stick" smooth. overall, impressed. 
 bought 10 these. worst product ever used. work advertised. nothing sticks

 purchased product send wife trip, complained typing blackberry. thought better install sending her, could guide along. pc is, tried download advertised. result: page found.company advised since discontinued item (?) took support pages.this would issue normally - install driver pc.it principle company maintain manufacturer's description web page support claim...you know manufacturer scumbag feedback/survey link gives error message back...if doubts read blackberry link bottom review page, click one star reviews. shame 
 seems keyboard acts little like gold fish bring home plastic bag pet shop. put whole bag tank acclimates it's new surroundings. went wanting love thing sheer coolness factor....to boxing send back wouldn't sync axim x50v....to giving another chance good ready work flawlessly, love again. keyboard smaller standard useable. it's great writing longer e-mail, inputting contacts, writing letter word, don't want peck screen stylus endlessly. construction feels solid opening closing snap. pun intended. major flaw cradle holds pda. removable desired use space pda little away you. feet clip keyboard don't want let go. plastic it's made doesn't seem especially robust feel certain snap eventually. also curved lower part cradle holds axim, et al, little developed bumped readily jettison it's holding. works well never ceases make grin everyone passing table starbucks stop ask it. previously gave one star, it's acclimated working give 4 cradle shortcoming else would full 5. know shows one star, amazon wholdn't allow edit scale. 
 struggled trying get thing work blackberry 8700g time. even selected downloaded driver listed blackberry devices product web site. lot frustration, finally got blackberry pair keyboard, would still recognize tried get link it. contacted igo product support informed that: "unfortunately, driver device currently." so, ended wasting lot time keyboard supposedly "for blackberry pda/handhelds."by way, carton state works blackberry devices, smartphones. fairly obscure barcode sticker back indicate, small letters, also works blackberry. case, though, back goes, really shame like quality item otherwise sure could made good use it. mean time, guess i'll keep looking.lastly, also agree reviewer vented stupid sticker place unit. glued keyboard front surface quite pain remove.

 won't work phone. 2 hours, got connect, won't answer get calls turn want make them. plus obvious scuff marks device. it's made cheap plastic charger old-fashioned two-prong adaptor. i'm going start looking better device ... especially one charges universal usb adaptor don't carry multiple cords me.

 sound quality excellent, earpiece flimsy irreplacable: terrific electrical engineering, poor mechanical engineering.i loved wasn't broken. even wind didn't seem bother headset much. voice quality great transmission reception. earpiece incredibly flimsy can't replaced. got new headset first time warranty. second time broke could gotten free replacement didn't want hassle. scala i've using months i'm happy it, even though sound wind-immunity doesn't measure logitech. 
 says it's compatible motorola handsets... doesn't work motorola/giant talkabout frs/gmrs/cb 2-way radios 2.5mm jacks. disappointing. 
 phone almost 6 weeks (40 days). 3 weeks middle row keys stopped working (a, s, d, f, g, etc). told call palm india, did, told keys covered warranty.i truly wish making up, really loved palm. fourth palm device, though likely last. run small real estate company works wireless telecom providers throughout nation. hope device could stop carrying three devices (my cell phone, palm t3 laptop). then, guys could stop carrying devices around.of course, took phone sprint, said palm's responsibility repair. raised stink looked blank eyes, always do. sprint seems like business trying run customers off.i called india back raised enough stink, said would give - one time - "free return repair," meaning would without phone 5-10 business days. also gave option paying additional $25 get refurbished replacement, complete 90-day warranty (which know means nothing). people honestly acted like biggest favor offering repair.i effectively called liar palm / india re-emphasize keys don't work, needed something immediately. don't understand made feel like criminal deal people, made feel like they're favor standing behind product. customer! doesn't mean anything anymore?i also sure understand customer service general become bad (though amazon's remains very, good). person spends $400 phone, device, work longer weeks. stop working, company sold stand behind product, instead looking ways squirrel responsibility. subsequent occurrence, friends / colleagues told problems treo 650s, well.there issues phone. box, power/sync cord work. returned sprint got tremendous hassle trying get replaced. (i ended buying seidio charger/cradle, works fine.) sound pretty bad - constantly adjust volume. every often, phone resets - can't figure one all. also, someone calls call-waiting, cannot disconnect active call without disconnecting incoming call; words, accept call-waiting call, automatically means two calls run simultaneously, even first party hangs up. plays heck monthly minutes.also, limited, non-intuitive ways power phone. don't get phone camera: cell phone cameras good placing pictures cell phone.otherwise, palm applications work should, past number years. expect nothing new different palm os part treo.all all, firm opinion never another palm device. company stop using palm, going slowly migrate away sprint (when contracts start expire).my apologies rant, simply seems companies become much bigger customers. excuse let move without me.are companies provide good customer service anymore? know mine tries to; otherwise, we're business. 
 specifically ordered headset eye glass clip. received order, clip would fit glasses, appeared extreme poor contstruction (the type would expect craker jack box).the headset would required pressing button answer call several times would actually pick call.the product process returned amazon.com. 
 bought, exchanged, returned unit. units delivered would turn on. charged using supplied adaptor, red charging light came hours later, unit supposedly fully charged. however, attempted turn unit pressing power button, nothing happened. unit never came on, could paired, never worked. returned them. understand one unit bad, two units shipped several weeks apart shouldn't be.when called technical support, waited hold sometime, gave up. 
 bought item @ local retailer, happy cause got sale (probobly clearance) well worked 2 days wire going unit self would get static touched! find receipt, e-mailed jabra & acting like isn't issue! wanting know many phones tried, tried 1 headset, etc.... prolly get accept return s&h charges stupid & worth replacement! get nice wired headset, less $ spent & less headache! 
 could longer obtain good quality bl-5c's finally gave nokia phone.i think last battery tried one these, actually worse performance battery used year trying replace.these might phonies china old chemically inert, afraid can't recommend these. 
 got timely mannor, put phone, chatged 12+ hours nothing ! never worked ! annoyed say least ! ordered time go hospital ce section wouldnt charge phone often considering bending painfull. lot good me. 
 bought bluetooth back-up pretty pink motorola h500. therefore, placed drawer needed replacement, last night needed it. plugged couple hours tried pair new phone work. charged overnight tried pair nothing (not one indicator light). plugged blue-tooth back charger, steady blue light tried pairing phone charger worked; unfortunately, walk around charger outlet attached head. consequently, lemon due months passed internet purchase, unable return exchange.therefore, moral story test everything purchase internet. learned valuable lesson. 
 device description. looked someone dropped vehicle hit road skidded way down. disappointed opening b/c first thing seen front damage.i email seller told nice refunded returned product back them. 
 unhappy didnt work time got husband heard last 
 bought phone cingular service. needed phone hurry. checked order next day, weird message:"order revisionorder placed october 08, 2005 10:35 pm pdtopen order -- order revision requiredhas approved phone service plan packages. please cancel necessary phone service plan packages order. cannot proceed order without action part. please aware take action item within 5 days, cancelled order.cancel necessary phone service plan packages"i idea cryptic message meant, essentially requiring cancel order. three cell phones family, perfect credit, earthly reason wouldn't approved cell phone account, message explanation. course, one amazon call explanation. don't know form missing information, something mistyped - idea happened. think amazon going cancel order, need explain me.i bought amazon before, usually good service, awful.i think amazon heads cell phone business.from comments, sounds like amazon fully honest transparent cell phone ads. 
 wife purchased v551s migration cingular 6 months ago. time (during phone never dropped, bumped, etc), i've replaced phone twice, once. problems we've include:- random "white screen death"- bluetooth connectivity problems (isolated phones)- dropped calls perfect reception areas- random battery indications- infamous "unable charge" problemadd motorola's lousy phonebook ui, retarded bluetooth handling (e.g., bt device connected, moto default ring sounds, regardless sound profile caller-specific ringtones), overpriced, overhyped, oversize paperweight.i'm fortunate cingular offers company's employees discounts new phones, go back sony ericsson. old t616 gave 2 years perfect service, even dropped twice. it's 2nd owner now, used 6 months problem-free. 
 doesn't stay even figure get on. ear plug piece big bulky can't hear. mouth piece way short one hear talk car road noise. cord short volume control cord inconvenient. get bluetooth give wire. 
 fell apart one use, person called couldn't even hear wasn't broken pieces. disappointed! :( 
 model, c150, one 4 jabra headsets ordered. continued try different jabra models ear piece far comfortable best sound quality ever used, however, 4 jabras poor microphone quality. one, persons end could hear me. disappointed. found worked well cell phone, cordless phone. 
 screwed up; shouldn't ordered this; it's use me. since real price hidden "shipping handling" it's pointless return it; i'll write "educational expense".i actually bought use cordless handset "hands free" 2.5mm jack. (siemens cordless phone system). owners manual says "...any 2.5 mm headset", that's bought. don't even know thing anymore; put back little bag forgot it.i tried three handsets system; plug simply captures line makes loud, "screeching" sound... ...playing plug, find one tenuous position quarter way hear audio phone, moment let slip goes back screeching.i can't get work anything else either including wife's samsung intensity (which also 2.5mm headset jack; results), don't access palmevery often something stupid; buying one occasions. 
 work since day got them.the right earbud never sound.i got replacement, it's situation.i sure it's i'm using nokia e71x, don't work properly. 
 there's problem design headset. jack used short. it's extremely sensitive movement. don't plugged way keep still, you'll loose connection. don't know designed way... 
 3rd "oem" battery bought via amazon marketplace -- others, terrible. ordered form oem shop br50. sent br56 supposed even better 3 hours talk time. last 30 minutes complete overnight charge. nowhere long battery trying replace lasts hour instead original 2 1/2 hours.oem sent counterfeit fake battery --- oem. tell? motorola oem batteries made japan. say clearly made china. problem returned battery wireless phone accessories batteries4less.amazon_- screening sellers addressing issues. ton posts every single one motorola razr battery listing say got bad counterfeit batteries.theses companies make money selling junk, counting amazon customer feel worth hassle return it. every one return lose hour time. time worth th $10 get ripped for. anyway b/c hopefully point amazon going take responsibility conduct market sellers. amazon's new logo become customer centric company earth. well amazon, start here: bargain cell -- one worst offenders, wireless phone accessories oem shop -- joke name last one since clearly know selling counterfeit batteries.i paid $30 one batteries4less hoping get real deal -- got exact batter got oem shop -- exact counterfeit. nothing price paid. dishonest online sellers. 
 agree reviews... people talk hear horrible echo due mic picking earspeakers sound... even set earspeaker lowest volume. i'm glad came free phone, i'd payed this... i'd pretty mad. 
 summary: stay away, product sports poor design...pro:+ low price+ small lightweight+ relatively easy use+ pair well bt phonescon:- morse-code like feedback signal - try accomplish many tasks single beep/tone. 1 short beep, 2 short beeps, 3 short beeps, 1 long beep, 3 beeps up, 3 beeps down. like another reviewer said, really read manual keep nearyby able understand beeping means.- echos matter volume set it, partly thing loud- insanely difficult open battery door. got frustrated, throw thing window. product use regular batteries, battery door difficult open. opened, need pair tweazers pull battery out. battery compartment deep extremely snug. must sick joke motorola. forget changing battery go, need sit tools lot patience. (for record: breaking point, return unit, installing battery first time enough turn-off)- sound quality mediocre best 
 tried putting galaxy s4 case kept popping out. seems like plastic casing small phone. disappointed. 
 returned came dented. like , wish could used it. said got last one. 
 product pretty inexpensive expectations. received quickly noticed flimsy plastic was. probably fit 2 credit cards top. might good case nights out, probably wont protect phone much. ended tossing flimsy. 
 case took almost week arrive. buy cheap case, you're going get cheap case quality. stay away. inside case contacts phone smooth all. scratch phone. looks someone dropped dirt. could clean whatever gunk case. thank god didn't scratch aluminium case. credit card didn't even slide way case. good luck trying fit two there. spend money else where. 
 phone fit junky case properly. completely worthless money grab seller. cheap coupon code doesn't fit! tossed case trash belongs. realize purchasing cheap case gamble, never expected bad doesn't even fit phone. completely useless. 
 worst product ever seen motorola. charges phone hold jack goes phone, also drive time.i bought belkin's similar product walmart $10 rocks. 
 bought one second time plugged light end went stopped working! thing junk, way replace fuse (if one) without destroying it. tried take apart, can't without breaking it. genuine motorola product stupid design. break open hope get back together toss it??? never problem car charger 10+ years owned cell phone, tell something! screw one up?! hire idiot designed one thats how! 
 omg got smallest piece junk ever paid :) really charger died 2 weeks pluged car.the charger made cheap plastic,light weight right worthless. 2 weeks pluged in,it never gave phone full charge,i drove 63 miles pluged phone yet still fully charge it.guess get pay for.so want more,then you'll pay more. 
 like barely sticks cigarette plug passat, close cover don't phone chord plugged in.even 2.1 port, charger cannot keep iphone 5s. every thing iphone (air plane mode, screen off, etc), gave 15% charge 2 hours. that's 7.5% per hour.when using waze gps charge drops 100% 90% 10 minutes.i would recommend charger. 
 product quality item very, poor. charging phone 15 minutes charger began overheat charge phone started fail. return item refund. 
 bought use brand new 2014 nissan altima. first time plugged in, worked jiggled right. definitely 2.0 amp charger either. spend extra dough get one directly t-mobile retailer. worth return shipping cost refund. buy feel like donating money foreign company asia, fun. 
 leather, smell atrocious. however, you're okay leatherette, nice pockets inside it's relatively thin/lightweight.i'd avoid seller though (boxwave corp). shipping $5 pay return item them. me, total waste money shipping costs alone likely far product worth. paid $30 case, $5 shipping me. i'll sending flat rate back. bear mountain cases better, real leather, cost less (about $20 ipad mini). 
 classic book iphone case flimsy cover remain closed. good protection iphone. 
 perhaps got bad one, thing won't consistently work 4 feet away phone, let alone 30 claim. it's nice design, worked i'd happy it.update: got new bt250v amazon kind enough exchange unit sight unseen (they even shipped new unit i'd shipped back bad one). unfortunately, new unit works somewhat better, still doesn't work well should. example, noticeable popping (interference) put phone pocket, even side headset. i've tried many combinations phone headset, time problem headset, i'm quite sure it's issue phone, bluetooth general. (in fact, i've far better luck jabra bt products.) so, design beautiful product great works, i've found fails really need it.final update: chucked it. don't believe breathless reviews this. use everyday life--i.e. phone feet head--people end hear static. got sick people asking "what's clicking sound?" threw stupid thing away. i'm amazed people love much. must floored idea wireless technology haven't actually tried using real conversation, haven't actually tried call another person. two bad experiences company, last jabra product i'll ever buy. 
 range headset pathetic - maybe 2 3 feet phone get decent signal (which defeats entire puprpose cordless headset imho). otherwise, horrific - static, terrible sound quality, etc. please waste money pos. swapped moto h850 much happier unit paired motoe815. 
 bt250 newer bt250v pure junk. sound quality two units horrid, ways describe it. friends coworkers identify units remotely asked speak using bt250 bt250v. microphone sooooo sensitive un-tuned, particularly unusable cars walking. road noise wind noise saturate voice. even ideal quiet surrounding, normal speech come muddy weak. battery life also shortens significantly 1 year warranty moderate use. button unit doesn't help usability. earhook design, one would push button direction perpendicular ear activate button, task easily done one finger pain. however, unit uses behind ear design, would use two fingers motion pinch earlobe activate button, it's truly unpleasant experience. addition, vibrate alert feature stupid useless. cases, one would wearing unit, audible ringing heard--why would need vibrate???i truly advise buying unit. 
 one worthless items i've ever had. troubleshooting information manual. works wants opposed want. charge doesn't seem last day without use. whoever thought blue flashing light ear stylish get lobotomy.i give bluetooth. mostly, nomo motoone star can't give lower vote. 
 returned product clearly used headset. scratches front, small dent. frankly want insert used product ear. went wal-mart bought product less money. 
 headset sound quality poor. end pick handset manually hear person end. defeats purpose hands free car. quiet room works fine. buy intend use car, bus train. 
 long-time motorola bluetooth headset user, tell painful experience fundamental flaws hs850. fact, went four hs850 headsets (under warranty) motorola decided upgrade h700 (despite lower model number, h700 newer model).the hs850 h700 characteristics:- over-the-ear swing arm earpiece used left right ear- flip-open boom microphone turns headset on/off- easy volume controls- toggle switch connect/disconnect calls (or put hold/mute)- easy pairing- good published battery life- standard motorola power connectorswhat's difference? well, "good published" battery life distinction. four hs850 headsets worked weeks months, would hold charge. battery life went minutes.dealing motorola support nightmare. apparently, support center products argentina, could script help me. fourth failure, insisted getting support contact corporate hq illinois. support contact dream. reviewing case, gave h700 replacement. headset 1.5 years, kept battery life functionality. course, lost buy replacement...and given choices, got another h700.do fall lower price hs850. i've seen prices low $15 model. think you'll frustrated disappointed end. 
 treo 650, sprint pcs, firmware update 1.08for part, actually like headset comfy, people seem hear well (the comfort big deal, often wear glasses)however, headset takes long time connect t650 --- good 7 10 seconds calls (and then, people hung up)in addition, volume okay car (or isolated places) forget using outside noiser environmentsi've heard works well moto products though ---- treo 650 users, highly recommend scala 500, fast connection times loud volumehappy shopping!!! 
 sucks.... want even keep one. first use non usb charger big bulk needs put trashed buried another planet. 
 sound horrible... people say sound like muffled tunnel. bought two, case bt ran down.... poor me..... plantronics 620 works like cr*p too. noise cancellation worth d*mn... forget using driving car.... trying find new one... 
 even though ear piece designed razor phone, ear bud big, uncomfortable keeps falling ear. two weeks use, on/off switch stopped working, feature main reason bought unit. sum, waste money. provision review "0" stars, gave "1" 
 don't see others liked this. doesn't add value -- doesn't make phone easier carry use, doesn't add significant protection, anything else. i'd recommend getting pouch slide-on clip, holds phone horizontally belt waistband. 
 ****updated oct. 18, 2010*sigh*i really tried make work worth hassle. previously speculated, wonder wearing glasses reason poor fit. traveled quite bit last weekend found that, often not, headset disconnected phone call. hands-free-device turned pull-over-and-muck-with-it-after-each-call burden. maybe didn't obscure setting correct looked couldn't find one. maybe mine defective, i'm sure really trouble worth. almost ten years ordering amazon taking advantage return policy first time.i found different headset 73% still $40 (orig $150 / plantronics discovery 925 bluetooth earpiece gold) comes chargeable case. never seen case protects also charges! colors bit more. check one wear glasses. fits ear, top, hoping better fit.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *i expecting reading reviews.let first say sound quality excellent. sent voice-mail rolling windows freeway without appreciable loss sound quality! amazing could barely tell difference "all windows up" "driver/passenger window down."however.... wear glasses rounder face. difficult place earpiece ear glasses on. bulky part doesn't sit well glasses' frame. mouthpiece adjustable. fuller cheeks mic comes contact face. sure made way since faces same. control buttons also difficult manage driving. main control side fine tiny on/off volume buttons hard find press without dislodging unit. turn place ear. maybe something sitting eyeglasses frame. like sound quality continue use coming back update. doesn't work well i'm sure one kids like it. (i ended returning it. see above)would also recommend getting case corral charger unit one place. 
 many people complained, found headset's microphone weak. person hear all. contacted plaintronics repair. repair process tracking, sending headset address. two weeks later, received used one back, one sent in, packaged oem box. although one better microphone new one sent in, battery reliable hold charge, also battery portion kind loose.i recommend plantronics product all. 
 jabra first came out, battery stopped charging 10 months. got one replacement, stopped charging year. problem bt earpieces, battery replaceable done industry wants to. make money selling whole unit vs pay 5-10 dollars replace battery. kind practice sustainable. i'm back wired headset. 
 tried two headsets horrible person speaking to. heard echo worse others, heard it. heard every word said repeated back nearly loud voice. annoying say least thank amazon amazing taking headsets back! 
 unfortunately, purchased mine $100 never able use it. didn't return right away thought would able read directions came figure unmute it, never able to. hear people, can't hear me. matter do, won't unmute. buttons small difficult use it's ear. finally got different bluetooth works fine. 
 razr v2 best cell phone ever graded razr v3 late last year (2007). razr v3 far worst cell phone i've owned. beautiful great features keeps failing 5 phones far (the original purchased one plus 4 refurbished replacements) 1st phone: couple months screen would light / 2nd phone would charge get go / 3rd phone month screen would longer light / 4th phone couple months screen would light / 5th phone working month now. really like razr phones, work v3 model terrible would rate lower 1 star possible. 
 purchased three 2 weeks. phone great, problem: battery doesn't stay firm place phone turns every 5 minutes. 
 searched "droid 3 chargers" making purchase. first product pop up, decent reviews, cheap. purchased 3. product arrived time. however product fit droid 3 phones. contacted customer service course 9 times. results replacement, return refund. contactd phone w/in first 2 min convo f-bomb dropped twice. offensive unprofessional. needles say, 3 chargers dont fit phones. anyone wanna trade? 
 looking for, therefore sent back. work droid razr maxx. 
 yea sound great, bluetooth signal awesome crystal clear hiss pop fading out. bad part headband breaks reason using it. got $50 piece junk can't use 
 people said, headphones bit heavy ears. 3 weeks crack headband started, 2 months crack big headphones stopped working. try returning replacement don't see why, design isn't smart headband cracking place stress. reinforced one spot.it's shame sound really top notch used able connect ipod leave bag, connect pc via 'bluetooth advanced audio' disturb wife i'm killing zombies half-life 2. 
 data, thick stiff cable, get pay for, keep looking better cable reviews pass 
 crap buy work phones paid four dollars. trashed 
 received today a1 accessories. bought solely use xbox live wouldn't keep moving headset use work (i work home). friends kept asking repeat myself. one said turn tv volume could hear (no lie). switched back headset back crystal clarity. that, threw one trash.. good thing cost $5 so. 
 model, c250 earwave boom, one 4 jabra headsets ordered. continued try different jabra models ear piece far comfortable best sound quality ever used, however, 4 jabras poor microphone quality. one, persons end could hear me. disappointed. ended getting ge tl26593 earset microphone jasco, best far. 
 (updated)+ good battery life+ comfortable (choice two ear bud tips, plus extras)+ easy use+ minimal bling appeal (blue light obtrusive)- first unit failed (charger, headset buggy) 3 weeks use- jabra support lackluster- ugly shiny mic piece (photo amazon accurate, see customer images)after three weeks use, stopped charging ac adapter. dropped audio connections dialing, 20 minutes conversation. (replacement unit also exhibited this, less.) contacted jabra charging issue, required a) return headset rma, b) send new one. less month use. found another way get replacement (boomerang purchase local chain 'tronics store.)on plus side, lasts standby days (vice hours like sony bt headset does). fits around ear, comfortably ear, easily. loop soft rubber, sharp rigid plastic clamping outer ear. sound quite loud enough (the volume controls easy find touch, in-ear speaker blast much), earbud gently pressed form seal, easier hear way. sound so-so, callers told can't hear there's ambient sound, music, wind, cars nearby. all, better average, second jabra product that's crapped me, wary. (i recommend always owning wired headset backup, particularly business important personal use.)** july 2008 update **i've used 2 years give much better review. unit held well (though tip broke glued back). still holds several hours charge, old sony headset lasts one 10 minute conversation dies. shape, weight, ergonomic fit unobtrusive i've companions remind i'm still wearing hanging call. although didn't like shiny "bling" microphone tip, i've softened design. bt500 still attractive less attention getting others. headset work, new car handsfreelink feature, use unit home, two years, still works great. recommend headset without reservation. (disclosure: use nokia 6682, tested phone models.) 
 used less week charged 3 times. fourth try green light disappeared wouldn't turn on.i bought loved jabra 250 still use it, matter fact.i really disappointed something like (for price paid it) would stop working good reason.i should've bought plantronics.don't waste money this. 
 hate phone...i drawn it's appearance size horrible dissapointment. get motorola mobile tools 'hack' volume could hear - loudest default setting low. display impossible see outside bright light, detest poor means displaying missed calls, caller attempted reach multiple times, displays last call time only. returned phone replacement dust display screen, told 'known' issue, replacement phones warranty expire month time original purchased. 
 hype says:"getting internet easy razr v3 supports cingular's gsm-based wireless internet express service. used cingular data plan phone's bluetooth usb data capability, phone used wireless modem laptops pdas."i say:caca! plan connecting internet using phone bluetooth better get mongo battery laptop it's slowest, laggiest, painfully irritating, useless piece doggy doo ever displeasure using! could run seattle knock amazon's front door faster connecting site.update: 6/7/2006i tested actual bandwidth connect 39.1 kbps, that's slower dialup 56k (53.3) modem. connected cingular's gsm says connected 115.2 kbps connect via bluetooth 230 kbps use usb cable. either way actual speed 39-41 kbps surely don't patience that.one last annoying feature ... cingular "brands" phones can't download games phone delete certain ringtones etc., providers. also annoying "hellomoto" video/commercial uses 25% available space videos own. way delete recapture waste space. truly worst product ever purchased. 
 like previous motorola phones i've had, one easy intutive system navigating numerous menus --- i'm sold using motorola reason, compared noxxxx, motorola great!pros:almost everythingawesome designgsmi found volume excellent compared last phone (motorola v60).good antenna, extremely low rate dropped signals --- also, since antenna protrude, anticipate require replacement (i replace antenna twice old v60 --- broke carrying pocket and/or dropping)excellent color screen.good camera phone.great size, easily fits shirt pocket.great battery life (with bluetooth off)easily customizable items never use (media mall, media net, etc.) remain prominent place put obscure location.cons:the significant negative feature screen --- extremely hard see sunlight.display front (when closed) hard read.price (if upgrading phone cingular --- wanted $199) however, since changing at&t; cingular able buy phone bestbuy $70.the manual comes better writen.screen gets oily normal use must wiped frequently.alarm clock interface could better.date book alert loud.accessory support cingular stores rather poor --- two cingular stores usb cable (had buy one wal-mart).of four five phones owned, one far best respects. even cons still eons ahead phones.edit: change 5 stars 1 star... loved features phone flip lid great. problem: 3 months screen would light --- took phone back at&t; sent reconditioned phone lasted month --- took one back, sent another reconditioned phone, long story > short: 5 phones one year, 5th phone finally worked kept working couple years. experience phone, buy another motorola. 
 cable ultra thin must shielded well. can't find perfect spot put ipod within 2 foot circumference cable - get ton interference. even find good spot still interference occasionally. another cable (non-retractable) foot long works fine - know interference something cable. 
 update:this silly 3.5mm cord lasted 3 months audio went retractor went cheap quality would buy went old standard non retractable cord 
 first all, ordered item image showed white black. ordered specifically match white iphone. thing fell apart taking box. returning garbage getting $5.00 back. last time ever purchase scosche product! 
 seller lost package facility took 2 months receive it. bought gift i'm glad took long get here. it's flimsy gets really tangled really easy. avoid costs. 
 bought plantronics 320 today. soon walked store,the reception went static beyond belief. salesman said "give chance", it's going back tomorrow. past week i've bought 4 headsets(motorola 500,850,700,& one one worst.i found motorola 700 best far. clear reception time,excellent volume(no problem hearing driving),& always connected treo 650. windy day friend end didn't even know got car,hardly background noise. ordered 700 amazon,much cheaper cingular & motorola. 
 unit looks big photo, brace yourself: it's like bad science fiction rocket ship arrives. made hard plastic odd fins protrusions everywhere. rest easily head. feels heavy abrasive. surprised none manufacturers come softer, lighter material, spent time considering fit headset ears head. sony better job drbt21g/b, also falls victim hard plastic hinge middle set digs skull time goes on. truly astonishing.i could get unit pair top-of-the-line sony bluetooth transmitter. motorola "kind" enough issue stern warning returning item without calling toll-free number. waste time. either don't answer hone, leave hanging long periods time hold. 
 got amazon. treo700wx(sprint) set breeze comfort earpiece excellent. however, keep losing connection 640 headset treo. headset beeps ear everytime connection lost happens often. double checked connection everything set per instructions. wondering defective unit anyone else experiencing problems. 
 well, idea sound like. wont work phone! connector made ericsson phone, stated anywhere description. however cheap, really cant complain much. 
 i'm third z520a six months i've owned it. reason haven't gone i've accepted phone lemon. phone freezes can't shut off, requiring removal battery reset, frequently drops calls, doesn't always let place calls, plain weird things result unreliable frustrating call experience. even annoying purchased expensive, model-specific accessories become useless paperweights replace new phone - phone additional hundreds on, mention cost accessories. i'll never buy another sony ericsson product. 
 design good would excellent product quality anything terrible. buttons extend arms worked exactly one time breaking. press press nothing happens. it's shame rest works decently.the suction cup holds well tube coming cup pretty sturdy. moves lot car moving would need rest dash would help somewhat perfectly.overall one star poor quality worthless spite good points. 
 even seemed flimsy first got stuck trying figure worked. get unstuck thought problem solved, wrong.after using couple days completely stuck longer functional. pretty upset husband really wanted work vehicle go searching another one hopefully don't run problem. 
 purchased phone cingular carry new razr mp3 player 1.3 megapizel camera settle one. swivel use keypad awful, one ever hear talking, (even use motorola h700 bluetooth headset), photos taken regular megapixel camera phone better 1.3 provided here, can't listen mp3 thru bluetooth, photos stored phone often become corrupted reason all, photos disappear occassionally turn phone back on, bulky heavy, battery times drains hour even without use, reception poor often stand wide open areas. overall, disappointed phone wish contract would allow trade in. gadget junkie reviews cnet led purchase phone truly regret it. go new motorola razr 1.3 camera mp3 player, features nice slim package. 
 everything works fine, sustain less two days lightweight use (most time standby status)i ordered two sony ericsson w600i wirefly, bundled cingular family share plan. phone locked cingular.talked sony ericsson support service, sony doubted may problem battery phone them.talked wirefly, decided exchange. 
 case garbage. got whats pictured. also nothing lined up. sent back promply. would purchase again. 
 watch people -- notched circular connection ear cushions fit opening plantronic voyager pro -- diameter small, fall out. however ordered "medium gel eartips",plantronics medium eartips voyager pro [3 pack] pack 3, connector fit. i'm keeping gel eartips (not item) throwing foam ones. 
 idea mean "motorola retail packaging", beware picture website. received headset loose plastic bag, along instructions charger. charger ripped it's bag used (the cord obviously re-wrapped secured grocery store bag tie).when complained amazon receiving used merchandise, immediately sent replacement via overnight, customer service person could cared less amazon selling used/returned merchandise.i received replacement today. doesn't look used, plastic baggie - packaging like webite shows. bought christmas present wife (to go pink razr) - i'm sure going impressed plastic baggie packaging. sure hope works better looks! really bad, amazon, really bad. 
 threw terrible volume/clarity ends. go scala 500- bought second (lost first) it's best market. 
 got lot static noise. connection good either. put phone within 6 inches away ear piece get better reception. regret buying it. one useless item money go drain. 
 reviews product good one piece would likely broke easily per reviews price point decided return it. 
 doesn't work, phone keep showing invalid battery. wasted money! thought returning it, it's cheap, don't bother. 
 wearing mintues, got blister swelling ears. insulator. hurt back ears bad notice blister. don"t know motorolla called themselve engineer. don"t need rocket scientist kind pads insulator protect skin 
 got defective purchase item still awaiting rma seller. really comfortable product wear. can't comment product never worked date. say bad buy rig comfortable wear. say look products meet needs. 
 upgraded nokia 6600 (which loved wasn't hottest looking phone) also motorola a630. phone nice, dainty, great display, ends there:*) speaker isn't loud enough, you're always pressing phone ear incredibly hard still can't hear well - called t-mobile, acknowledged problem sent instructions phone increase speaker volume avail.*) slider hard get quickly - try sliding phone open, many times actually reject call.*) using call waiting isn't bad - go call waiting easy, retrieving call painful*) text messages - worst ever - first, slide phone open, create message, hit enter key, recent log, select recipients, next enter message sends. nokia create message, hit green button, enter destination, hit green button.*) deleting messages worse! select message, hit options, hit delete (sometimes it's 4, sometimes 6), "are sure", hit yes, done. nokia, select message hit "c" instantly done.*) bluetooth - it's supposed convenient, no, always asked want connect - thing auto-connect! every time get car get phone pocket unlock phone, hit yes, i'll nagged every seconds noise. oh, hit (when someone else car don't want calls going car) it'll ask 5 seconds. arrrgh!this baby going back! i'm gonna try blackberry 8700. 
 ordered 2 couple weeks ago, got decent time put phone charged them, neither battery lasted 48hrs max less 10 mins talk time.sent email company nice sent 2 batteries plus return envelope send first two back with, put next ones, charged thing within 48hrs batteries dead virtually zero talk time them.sending 4 back.im guessing basically get pay for. 
 don't get wrong h3 looks good sleek gives much feed back. mean phone, party hears echo. happend calls. thing kept returning lost receipt threw away box! don't recomend wasting money this. one may try worked h500. cheap looks ok best all, works!!!! oh yeah razor hard time linking h3. 
 bought direct amazon, "unlocked" phone technically unlocked, cingular-branded firmware.for anyone familiar that, "branded" euphemism "hacked carrier remove features replace useful menu options links buy stuff." guess "branded" shorter saying that.this "clean" l7. may well buy unlocked cingular phone ebay.i yet checked features see removed phone, although immediately notice even signed java applications require constant "permission", unbranded phone would accept verisign certificate. 
 pouch felt clumsy. extra play phone could wiggle around in. also clip thin it's good sweatpants scrubs. weight phone, flip it's clipped onto belt. 
 first headset sent doa. told pay return shipping replacement unit would sent out. received another unit guess what..... correct another defective unit. tried contacting seller multiple times responded. anybody want good deal broken headset? 
 product arrived time several people including personnel verizon, apple could get connect phone. sent back. 
 bluetooth headset probably one worst ever waste money on.for odd reason motorola bluetooth, including one really really bad static.i cannot clearly hear person person cannot hear me.i would save money buy different brand altogether.motorola h700 bluetooth headset 
 saw reviews headset cnet, pretty excited getting use lg vx-9400 phone. verizon sales agent recommended h700 version bluetooth. reason gave jabra bt350v lots static using 9400.well, results h700 actually worse. callers end said static painful ears bad. heard static end never case headset phone pairing i've had. one day, boxed back sent back amazon.one thing note. must taken context phone paired with. using lg vx-9400, experience likely different. possible, find headset others already used phone reported success with. otherwise rolling dice. sites like howard forums (google it) good finding others experienced. good luck! 
 purchased product dive trip fiji. fiji decided take kayak camera inside 'waterproof' case. case sitting legs trip slid water. water maybe 2&#34; deep. didn't even completely submerge case. ways wanted take picture resort. lifted case knew issue right away water came pouring out.my camera ruined 2nd day 10-day vacation. place find another camera. would better putting camera pocket case.do purchase item! 
 motorola better. product would install ether state art computers. find program another source. save headaches. 
 i'd like say satisfied device, i'm not, att version whatever reason sooo much better phone tracfone, basically phone.just stupid phone!!!the att version good, good phone!!hello guys, reviews today phone used tracfone motorola c139.1st phone, worked good, bathroom flushed toilet went phone, course dead gone sewer.2nd phone. phone at&t; service, instead tracfone, noticed possible ui change, better service fact could use prepaid personal at&t; put sim lock pay go sim cards.the phone wasn't good texting pretty good also games, got addicted one ball kind like brick attack, found keyocera phones, totally forget name.3rd phone, tracfone got sister, washed hose, fell got sprayed red dot prove this. got screen change colors call different people contacts, tried drying stopped even working even phone, would go tracfone turn screen reset something like press button itd go off, battery would die.it still mysteriously charged, used moto charger, planned found phone battery get lit keypad. took apart, voided warranty, since wet. got nothing figured replace recycle did. 
 beware tracfone. regret amazon won't let give 0 stars. got phone wife's aunt last december. 1 year trying get working, still cannot receive calls. call out, one call her. tracfone support useless (and generally marginally speaks english). also cannot manage phone minutes line. call give 60 digits phone shows almost anything. we're letting one die 400 units left basically useless. coverage isn't good either, cares can't receive calls anyway? got better option, doubt many worse ones. 
 sucks, never worked, hated it, threw away. total waste time- many better products there. 
 poor product quality. lost iphone 3gs due water leak using product. working ok occasion sometime (couple months using) stop working water start leak. 
 bought cruise protect phone, cash delicate items cruise. 5 minutes water noticed 1/4 full water. bottom developed hole extremely light use. cost? ruined iphone 5s. nightmare. guess stupid trust 12 dollar &#34;waterproof&#34; pouch 600 dollar iphone. lesson learned. 
 don't buy adapter!! picture shown receive, picture shows genuine nokia adapter get cheap piece crap doesn't even specifications nokia adapter. don't want fry device, don't buy this. 
 want warn professionals verizon wireless phone data email service inappropriately spoofing sender's email address messages sent motorola q. creating problems anti-spam filters also believe unethical illegal. recommend buying phones data/email service organization.when configure imap server option motorola q phone owned one executives, verizon system "spoofing" email address messages sent email server. external spoofed internal messages get blocked anti-spam filters.when wanted try "white list" (unblock) verizon servers anti-spam server, technical support verizon representatives refused give us ip addresses servers email messages sent. probably refused network administrators security concerns don't blame this. i'm sure agree problem instead resolved within verizon's system software solution.instead spoofing desired email address, messages coming verizon phones distinct "from" "reply-to" addresses, first external verizon wireless address, latter customer's desired commonly used email address. two must differ messages end spam sender won't spoofed.although q seems like good device, advise purchase don't support email integration organization verizon wireless makes "from" "reply-to" fields configurable. small shops microsoft exchange loose anti-spam settings probably won't problems like this. 
 reluctantly getting 3rd q (replacement). i've 2nd one maybe 2 months. would freeze constantly past 2 months forcing remove battery restart. dreaded black screen death "motorola flash mode bootloader version: boot_c_03.08.00r_mpap". anytime bloggers start naming phone dies bad sign! 
 phone experience:its light sleek perform well basic phone, charge every 2 days 2 times day use smartphone.this phone's interfaces old looks like using old bulky nokia phones specially switching smart-phone. slow limited capabilities. krzr seems lot better interfaces.verizon experience:at least getting many dropped calls cingular. much better reception.some things encountered far are: verizon charges 1 month advance monthly access fee, first month activation cost $250-300 excluding phone cost. next, charged $15 ported old number, past received service free t-mobile cingular.customer service friendly all.amazon experience:the sad part story starts received phone.i opened box looked like used phone, dust inside plastic protector edges coming scratches mini-sd card goes. thought big deal called verizon, came resolution couple calls hold time goto store free replacement. went store, lady kept trying nothing happened answer oh may bought phone amazon customer service take this.ha, don't know earth amazon don't care customer satisfaction all. one help you. emails lost hopes stuck phone.now think shouldn't bought here, thru verizon least get new phone.my 2 cents don't buy here, worth buying verizon directly long term. 
 bought two one charging use one.big mistake!!! stop charging reasonsit works ok months. 
 keeps flling ear. work past 4 feet. bought jabra 125 love 
 sound garbles badly battery runs within hour. neat looking headset functional. 
 buy handsfree. give damaged product...and send other...and damaged tooo..i buy nokia products never send damaged product.. quality department samsung???dont buy samsung products!!! please wise!!!! 
 bought headset recommendation picky friend, figured would great. wrong. ear loop cumbersome put on, ear bud stay average ear. worse, place headset recharging box (???? happened simple plug??), meaning ear loop needs come off. jabra ear gel fits unit . . . ear piece needs come recharge. nail coffin ear piece volume terribly low, necessitating constant shove finger ensure aural leakage, even ultra-quiet toyota sequoia. fair, sound quality reported good, drawbacks far outweigh pluses. 
 ordered thing sep 19th. ship oct 26th! don't even get started stupid reasons customer service gave stock item took long ship. anyway, finally got it. excited great reviews read. saw ear hook, like what! flimsy piece cr@p! thought myself, "this going break soon use it, better leave on." utter amazement! take charge dumb thing! second charge, guess what? broke! big surprise! hold unit ear use it, fall out. ear hook great, thing still fell even ear hook. can't really comment well thing works, can't keep charged. first complete charge, died one phone call. hour phone call, gee whiz! 5th bluetooth ear piece, little experience things. biggest complaint others low speaker volume noise interference. wish would chance test one it's going back amazon. maybe file rma wait month half ship back them. lol! 
 case worthless motorola hs815 headset. every time put headset case, case squeezes activation button headset. maybe work headsets activation button outside surface. 
 used motorola h500 worked well phone. unfortunately misplaced it. eventually bought another one via amazon. got it, worked hissing crackle sound. thought phone problem would eventually go away. not. suppose brand new headset. it's defective return immediately. i'm giving supplier 1 star. 
 acted thought muted wasn't. tried two separate cell phones thing phones. person called could hear first syllable it. try turn mute off, change frequency buzzing sound person heard. 
 agree device works advertised sound quality pretty decent headset caused heartache annoyances outweigh benefit. buy prepared device turn opportune times..... want turn off, thats whole different story. powering device requires holding button certain period time problem time required seems change time it. add holding button period time shorter period time required turn actually redial function. frequently called someone trying turn device. button also entirely sensitive. i've device cargo pants pocket (where would little pressure device) unit turned actually called someone.other issues charging indication isn't real clear isn't idea knowing charged battery device isn't quite comfortable devices used (its bearable definately comfortable money). 
 thought thing would great small could use normal chargers broke soon bought it. 
 product came without shipping slip, protective packaging. .bluetooth placed plastic bag, slipped envelope mailed. quality poor. crackling, buzzing muffled sounds annoying diapointing recieve something expecting use time able use it. would recomend vendor anyone. description stated clearly would packaged retai packaged pictured extra items. came bluetooth charge cord; instruction accessories this. 
 although weight, sound battery good, really dislike headset's design. totally predictable person thing every day never gets dirt cuffs, it's ok. go, wire clip come loose pocket computer bag. pen holder doesn't anything shield clip, fact adds weight causes force exposed headset. recrimp loop make tight enough come loose. pen cap required baggage good reason. rather give standard mini usb connector device, must haul cap everywhere. hey, don't always wear shirt pockets. two weeks misplaced trip expensive headset sitting shelf ponder whether buy another useless pen clip cook connector. excuse non-standard connectors charging solutions, watch company again.(several months later) finally tossing headset. pen clip holder eventually found tried make go device. don't like get rid working items, earpiece ear hook fall many times pocket last time, fell elsewhere lost. would believe couldn't even stand pressure inside suit coat? get box carry in, cumbersome charging holder, doesn't matter would buy new hook earpiece. ordered motorola h500, lower cost, lots color choices long talk time plus standard mini usb jack. got travel case less $4. got one daughter xmas proved better headset. 
 sound horrible car. fiancee said sounded like bubbling noises talking via headset. called home left message answering machine. horrible! could hardly hear sounded like bubbles fish tank. garbage. mileage may vary, would highly recommend consider different headset. 
 really don't lot time. shop online, i'm purchasing item used make life convenient, like bluetooth headset, really obnoxious receive one &#34;worse sucks&#34;. item even charge. plantronics really needs pull item really damaging reputation sale. choose plantronics regional sales manager/road warrior, i've always luck plantronics. bad one lemon. 
 product junk. less month stopped working. dont waste money. 
 arrived went plug noticed one prongs bent. went bend back broke! noticed rust base broken prong. i'm sending back refund won't buying another one. 
 work iphone 3gs all. first time tried said accessory optimized iphone. think amazon remove listing. 
 buy charger. probably never see review nobody wants know charger apple device!! destroy it! 
 money waste? buy item. broken 2nd day use stand phone. rated 1 star less 
 wouldn&#8217;t recommend item white.....it discolored within one week purchase. case discolored quick normal use. 
 last one week....the belt clip made cheap plastic...! like kick stand watch movies it....do buy....d 
 work well cheap. sending back today! waste cash product all. got many better quality cases different places amazon one. 
 snapped belt clip less week getting car. problem many style cases have, look metal clips instead plastic. real problem note 2 big enough matter time snags something matter careful are. clip cheap weak, phone going floor holster worthless clip snaps off. 
 case belt phone slid right busted pavement. get real caste. 
 soon wrote recommeded product broke, quite 3months, need relacement already, understand customers concerns now, could stand test time! 
 well got boxwave holster went use first time today crack side want replace ment please send replace ment ( belt clip side case crack ) 
 cheap clip broke less week. first day, clip/kickstand popped off. clipping belt, natural movement going day would pop clip case phone would hit ground. days clip popping off, putting back on, plastic held clip broke. definitely wouldn't recommend this. 
 received 7th, broke 10th. didn't hit anything catch anything. stay away cheaply made garbage. 
 case would ok fit. none holes line up, camera slot, stylis port etc. gladly accept another holster fit correctly. phone large need belt clip. 
 bought three different tpu cases lg g2. case simply fit. top bottom stay tight phone bulges. also, case form fit nice curved sides phone. 
 ordered case 9 days ago..it arrived yesterday. tracking give tracking number.....wheres case.. charged card product.. 
 review boxwave case stand. reason say boxwave nine different cases one listing! could understand &#8220;size&#8221; option different models phones, different cases misleading, probably saves boxwave money listing fees.as actual case&#8230; bought one &#8220;best cases&#8221; s4 per cnet. don&#8217;t know deal is, however case pure garbage! cutout bottom microphone off-center microphone actually covered! result, sounded muffled person end line. cutout camera way. normal pictures, ok case block lens, however partially cover flash. result, get glare bottom photo flash.the kickstand useless. nothing lock place, phone falls unless balance &#8220;just right.&#8221; even then, tap screen (ie: skip tube add), phone falls over. also hinge back phone causes phone lay flat.i paid $4 case, got type quality one would expect $4 case. would suggest case looking kickstand case. cases listing &#8220;might&#8221; better quality case, however, would hold breath. honest, cheap quality case received, deceptive nature listing, buy another boxwave case. 
 ordered cover protect new sgs4. covers phone, holes mics dont line centered holes buttons nearly impossible push (you really reef them). 
 don't buy cheap ugly product! worst mistake buying case phone. eew! never again! no! no! 
 bought two, sent three; took 4 weeks get mail, they'd warned purchasing; wrapped look like oem, i'm thinking it's fake; people selling certainly haven't responded complaints; works longer 4 6 year old oem batteries scavenged folks dead moto v3 razrs. wish could give stars one. 
 bought battery several years ago razr v3, battery shot it, shoulda saved money. worth time, effort money. wouldn't hold charge longer hour. probably relevant review today, still worth money 
 extremely disappointed product. isn't sellers fault, razor can't hold charge longer 35 minutes.i bought battery expectance maybe would better. totally wrong. thankfully bought new phone.don't waste you're time buying new battery,instead save buy new phone! trust did. 
 don't wast money battery china made won't hold charge. bougth 2 end throwing away. 
 3rd "oem" battery bought via amazon marketplace -- others, terrible. ordered form oem shop br50. sent br56 supposed even better 3 hours talk time. last 30 minutes complete overnight charge. nowhere long battery trying replace lasts hour instead original 2 1/2 hours.oem sent counterfeit fake battery --- oem. tell? motorola oem batteries made japan. say clearly made china. problem returned battery wireless phone accessories batteries4less.amazon_- screening sellers addressing issues. ton posts every single one motorola razr battery listing say got bad counterfeit batteries.theses companies make money selling junk, counting amazon customer feel worth hassle return it. every one return lose hour time. time worth th $10 get ripped for. anyway b/c hopefully point amazon going take responsibility conduct market sellers. amazon's new logo become customer centric company earth. well amazon, start here: bargain cell -- one worst offenders,wireless phone accessories nowthe oem shop -- joke name last one since clearly know selling counterfeit batteries.i paid $30 one batteries4less hoping get real deal -- got exact batter got oem shop -- exact counterfeit. nothing price paid. dishonest online sellers. 
 second one sent me, complete trash. 1 2 charge cycles dies within 5 minutes fully charged. buy 
 product (version 4.0) works v3 v3x. work new v3e.i using overpriced version 4.0 disc purchased directly motorola.software updates still recognized v3e. sure models listed work don't, fact non-supported models seem listed sufficient skeptical go elsewhere. yeah, it's penny, plus lot shipping!so, software works you, pretty nice. not, you're out. gave review one star based fact model know doesn't work supported list. 
 got two headsets high reviews.used headsets ps3, lot troubles getting work correctly sync console.the audio seems static mic doesnt transfer voice clearly.i bet better options. maybe arent real jabra headsets? 
 worst item i've ever purchased. brand new batteries wont' even fully charge phone once. don't buy it. regular stores stopped carrying keeps getting returned doesn't work worth darn. 
 wanted use rechargeables (good performance inexpensive) keep briefcase backup charger.that theory. use anything lithium (very expensive) alkaline (poor performance) positive contact touch. (i tried 6 different brands rechargeables)i ended taking apart (disassembly fairly easy) put solder blob positive terminal. makes contact nimh batteries battery cover thing really flimsy. add blinking blue light - certainly gets attention ends annoying. tried charge moto q car (while using bt headset) cover charger coat.i ended buying noname made china charger less half price, screw battery cover red led rather super bright blinking blue ones. course, accepted rechargables modifications.basically better designed products lot less. 
 best bluetooth headset i've owned terms comfort sound quality. microphone seemed fine.the ear pieces unfortunately attached head band via thin plastic. case, experienced structural failure 14 months light usage.if you're going spend $100 headphones, buy something stout particular model. 
 avoid avoid avoid. hold charge. useless piece junk. get something better made. pos. 
 first one got stopped working month later, motorola replaced supposedly newer one. new one continues work but- person side cannot hear correctly- lots static like noises even fully chargedfor excellent customer service, give 5 stars motorola 1 (or 0) star particular product.update: this, tried plantronics voyager 510 bt earpiece. also issues (while better motorola t305), gave bluetooth went wired in-ear sennheiser headphones 
 good long term. phone gets really warm charging. instead go original chargers. u spend 200-300 usd phone u afford original charger. stopped using couple times. 
 charger one cheapest, wasn't worth savings. less month product stopped working upon examination clearly fried! even outer plastic looked though melting. definitely worth it. 
 holster looks nice, seems well made strong clip it's tight put phone presses buttons way causing sorts unwanted things happen. put phone upside keep happening. way works fine. weird. 
 still waiting product since ordered january 1 2010 (3-5 days shipping) 
 poorly built phone holder. &#34;arm&#34; moves broken opened box due arm attached thinest piece plastic. slight torque arm could easily break off. 
 terrible quality, didn't fit vents securely. flopped around driving..tried take broke. waste money. 
 sticky dash mount broke tried remove it, one arms shortly afterwards. also, comes instructions, guess orientation pictures. 
 wasn't expecting much price least holds iphone, barely squeezes good amount force, slim skin cover. worth returning disappointing. 
 jeep liberty dont much dash board. (sticky past kept coming off) tried car vent stay comes handy. would recommend product. 
 kinda small phone advertisement said fit gs3 even took case still didn't fit one holders completely broke off! gs3 don't buy it's trash 
 terrible unit. magnet strong enough iphone 4s. ended buying differnt model 25 bucks connects cd player slot one amazing. 
 mobile service providers claim type antenna work, agree them. installing actually reduced reception 2 bars bars! search internet, find passive antennas like different battery compartment sticker claimed improve cell phone reception, block radio waves frying brain, etc. doesn't work it's waste money.i recommend buying wired antenna directly connects phone. phone doesn't connection, may want look different phone nothing without direct connection going work, may want look phone gets better reception (there -- read 3rd party reviews).i wouldn't recommend product anyone unless money burn. so, please send paypal account instead. 
 zero effect. windows must already allow enough signal make difference. bought back place get full bars right outside patio, almost none inside (i live concrete apartment). put phone place this, get good reception, didn't extend signal any, act repeater. didn't seem help car either, don't really need there. 
 nothing. noticeable change. used time. time anything it's phone. 
 spots around town calls get dropped use cellular phone driving car. areas small, 300 feet long. hold phone outside car drive areas, calls don't drop.i bought device hope would allow keep calls going without rolling windows. unfortunately, found absolutely difference calls dropped without device.when took device off, broke open took sides apart. didn't find evidence components inductively couple antenna interior components.however, installed, **look** impressive. so, want fake cellular antenna make car look "cool," fit bill perfectly. want performance improvement, consider one wilson cellular repeaters instead. 
 looks great fits dock fine pull sleve. phone loose one-two power bars on-two wifi rings. take they're back. 
 looked reviews, sure received something else what...this case looked cheap. broke side time...(haven't even 24 hrs).i sure photo one recv'd look anything like this. 
 guess get form trying cheap out. used piece connect regular headphones xbox 360, hold device place turn right order work. soon moved stopped working again. 
 careful know need. picture shows 4-conductor 2.5mm 3.5mm needed. however, specs say 3.5 2.5 sent. also, note 3-conductor stereo headsets. 4-conductor need using phone headset/microphone. 
 thought headset computer 3.5mm plug would able used plugging converter cable would fit att 2 line office phone. not. price low, would cost send back cost buy. bad purchase. 
 battery received new...i thought buying new battery instead received battery better condition one replacing. fair went back looked doesn't actually say "new" description, doesn't say "used" either. picture new battery describing "original" leads people believe receiving new, original oem replacement part. case. called customer service number answering machine asking name, order number, detailed description calling. somehow get feeling get lot calls complaining use screening method. seller shady allowed sell amazon. recommendation...do not, circumstances, buy anything seller! 
 purchased motorola s9 2 months ago, worked fine 1 month. buttons stopped working consistently, finally stopped working together. got agreement motorola replace headset warranty month ago, shipped back still headset. called got typical call center garbage, putting hold, disconnecting call, etc. finally got someone line claimed headset stock receive yet. never notified this, asked would stock told know, could call back week. told going ok, claimed resubmitted order would receive week. shall see...do buy headset, many people trouble buttons customer service terrible getting remedied. 
 o.k., o.k., know numerous reviews warn headphones fail sweat them, decided try anyways. want use workouts, ignore warnings - go buy something else.i received yesterday, paired blackberry, headed gym. worked great 30 minutes, left speaker controls left side (volume up, down, phone buttons) ceased work. definitely sweating, come don't even last 30 minutes??? sent back amazon morning. maybe i'll try jaybirds next- 
 pros: good pairing consistent stream. decent sound although loud enough.cons: uncomfortable fit(my ears hurt hour on), lots background noise, sound doesn't get loud enough pulic busy places, extremely annoying wear jacket since keep feeling catch.bottom line: don't buy it! participles good device need improve design make lot comfortable people start enjoy using it. 
 purchased trip hawaii could listen pandora phone hanging beach. absolutely work. tried phone fully charged phone battery still drained. worth purchase wish could get money back. oh well. 
 know it's $4.50, piece garbage outdated (made 2007) museum. first, comes tips. ordered it, thought would something base unit. haven't used refuse invest money this...it old probably won't work galaxy s3 does, would probably able power much.i bought desperation hurricane sandy hit. regret buying wasting money..... p u r e -- g r b g e! 
 cellet garbage. two brand cases broke soon buying them. claim leather really faux leather aka. plastic faux leather thickness dollar store condom. 
 get pay for. price seemed good true was. battery didn't last return immediately. 
 mounted anywhere near radio, often case, completely kill reception, fm am. even nothing plugged it. makes worthless me. avoid.they need better shield this! 
 unit puts much rf interference kills radio stations also kills fm traffic alerts garmin. unplugged radios return normal. may due car set up. 1998 honda accord. 1 12volt plug radio. may close. may better results. 
 buying headphones terrible mistake. sound flat lifeless volume controls nothing. bought use palm pre. don't know problem pre related, pre's bluetooth stack lot deficiencies, lousy headphones. either way combination pre headphones good one, palm pre owners avoid these. cheap pair wired headphones order magnitude better sound used pre. 
 found every piece igo inferior quality worth money. box toss wouldn't resell something worked poorly iffy best work. 
 finally gave products connectors always iffy. wouldn't recommend igo items. several box. won't even sell them. 
 headset purchased pair new storm, terrible, muffled called side sounded like tunnel caller side. tried several different phones, landline, cell area codes even international, result. pairing blackberry storm don't bother.i returned replaced blueant z9i amazing difference, clear bell ends call, great noise cancelling seems pair problems, also pair 5 devices switch called phone.hope helps someone. 
 worked fine stopped working. could hear ok person could hear faint voice. four months usage. won't buy another brand. 
 purchased product based cnet recommendation. cnet reliable source technology purchases. however, disappointment. unit eliminate sound effectively, volume controls "mushy," microphone/on switch stay retracted, resulting constantly discharging battery. pair easily, voice activated controls worked well. would purchase another, would advise others avoid model. 
 purchased reading positive reviews. paid attention negative reviews talked microphone wand acts on/off switch.i used total 6 times "wand" refuses go back. mechanism allows retract working result always on.when went amazon return it, would let return saying last date return passed vague language partial credit etc.so opened warranty ticket blueant. let's see works.i disappointed amazon clearly explain products go defective month. 
 good. cable super thin cheap. retracting mechanism broke like 3 pulls. 
 don't buy it. wearing one month already de area belt cracked. liked shape, model, s4 zerolemon super battery. said don't last use day. 
 bought case despite negative reviews due needing stuff asap sprint shipping new s4 dread everything need right away..i using case samsung s4 hyperion samsung galaxy s4 5200mah extended battery + black back cover (compatible samsung galaxy 4 models) [18 month warranty] **now nfc / google wallet** hyperion samsung galaxy s4 extended battery honeycomb matte tpu case / cover enlarged battery door. case performed great 2 weeks, glue stopped holding seams together stress points case. bought mine deci accessories. cannot recommend case. 
 stitching coming handful occasional uses. stitching bottom belt clip strap coming -- half now, uses past two months. otherwise model seemed perfect carrying motorola droid razor m. written positive review first week, review pulled. 
 someone, somewhere dark sense humor. ordering ca-100 cable waiting brown truck happiness arrive, discovered inside amazon box sealed package festooned nokia logo "ca-100" model designation. back package says "nokia original accessories" too. inside sealed box nokia branded ca-101d cable. means instead ca-100 cable usb connector one end, nokia 2mm connector other, ended cable micro-usb connector one end. so... joy. $6 cable i'm going burn gasoline time returning it. always use cable devices. however, cannot recommend vendor all. 
 i've tried several cell phone signal boosters, say, one worth dime. boost cell signal? maybe...a little....sort of... really. yes, bars sprint phone jump tad turn on, it's barely noticeable certainly worth exorbitant price. one feels like tech snake-oil. no, moving different locations made difference. nothing did. thing placebo. don't bother. 
 unit received contained instructions; problem go online company site get them. easy install put unit near window anywhere service (at least one bar) put antenna least ten feet away. antenna cable 20' difficult go unless going cable front you, next problem cell phone near unit 15' x 12' office could move unit antenna around could get green light also phone within 6' antenna. gave hour moving get green light moments back red. nothing improve signal since could get green light, presumably would indicated signal cell phone would pickup. may try four person sprint device company has? 
 ordered 3 them, 2 came without issue, 1 problem, got difficult get replaced, company ordered told go jabra directly, jabra website, entering info per requested, simply send email resolve trying notify via email (no phone #), i've asked exchange again, replied ask process again, it's never ending. bad customer service. 
 stylus used two days mesh surrounding tip began separating. point usable reliable. purchase item again. also bought trent limir dual purpose stylus working quite well. 
 one accurate. compared several high quality meters work, 4460 always off, often different direction different amount.i miss display amps older model had. useful determining circuit loads cases amp clamp convenient.it also hogs outlets standard duplex receptacle, one covered unusable. (yes, pigtail would help)i e mailed company twice inaccuracy inconsistency, receive reply.it became inaccurate finally died. 
 update: display failed completely product. buttons 'beep', readout blank. pos. back initial review.i placed 5000 btu ceramic heater device see actual usage. device showed around 11 amps constant pull, left plugged overnight heater ran. several hours later checked kill watt again, warm, receptacle deformed around plug, making impossible remove.this device supposed nema-rated outlet capable 15 draw. customers use kill-a-watt for, monitor real time use. clearly one could handle prolonged use, wonder sold gray-market product. 
 maybe bit harsh title, put something would grab attention. want save trouble none reviews myself. reviews great bought it. say sound pretty decent, similar slightly worse wep200. wep410 looks stylish, doesn't fit right ear. feels like going fall doesn't sit angle pointing ear cheek, wep200 does. sits angle noticeably flaring outwards. looks like sticking cheek 30-40 degree angle, looks extremely odd. tried three different sized earbuds, luck them. get fit ear, fit earbuds poor. even got father try headset see deformed ear canals, also didn't fit right. really wish could return this, since opened can't. sadly, give headset father. (he doesn't care poor fit long use hands free calling car)bottom line buy headset, buy samsung wep200. headset excellent price light weight headset also one want like ear buds like myself. don't like big bulky "android" looking blue tooth sets take bunch room. 
 paid $90 this. would stay ear. tried every ear adapter every way possible. fell ear every time. lucky happened car time, able find it. finally fell somewhere lost it. don't think got 4 days use it. want feel totally ripped off? get product, pay lot money watch disappear.it worse that. comes junk plastic case, useless storing charger stuff. pay much money something, provide nice case storing charger, manual, shorty cable. little box provide hold together. need new case right away. little bits pieces guaranteed scattered lost.also, first charger failed. discovered plugging computer using usb connection. jabra gave sorts headaches get new one. took several messages asked serial number. try find that? couldn't. exchanging several email stupid charger told remove rubber earpiece find serial number. couldn't read it--it small read.so want blow fuse anger. get this. aneurism, stroke, headache get treated like c$%p customer service. 
 ok, partner wanted jawbone advertising noise canceling ordered 2. arrived put charger. one jawbone broke even first use: battery fully charged half jawbone came charger tried disconnect - horrible charger connection. so, sent one back replacement. started using one that's left. jawbone connected ok motorola q phone rings headset not; press answer button - nothing; press answer button phone phone works like bt headset connected. tried 4 different phone result. so, next day sent second one replacement.a week later two new headsets arrived. charged them, connected phones ... malfunctioning again. one could hear caller caller hear anything. tried 4 phones - same. sent replacement. second jawbone loud statick cracking audio sent back next day.a week later two new headsets arrived. one would connect phone. second cracking noise. tried call aliph, manufacturer (no toll free number available support) 4 days, left numerous messages - one ever returned one call. sent numerous email messages - nothing back.so, would highly recommend stay away undeveloped product. idea great, need complete testing phase product still early testing. 
 jawbone bluetooth headset really made well lot worse people seem give credit for. parts fall short time cheaply made. looks metal really cheap bendy plastic material.further, set up, use one ear. headsets (like plantronics ones example) allow swivel earloop switch ears get tired using one ear. jawbone doesn't this.while jawbone's noise cancellation seem good that's going voice still sounds muffled, soft digital-like. further, jawbone big bulky comfortably put pocket take you.but main complaint aliph jawbone company customer service itself-they absolutely horrible. advertise website jawbone 1 year manufacture warranty end consumer. but, jawbone broke contacted getting warranty service it, rudely informed provide warranties units bought directly website. bought retailer, zero warranty! i'm sure whether even legal since i'm lawyer, believe reflects poorly company don't even stand behind products.i would never recommend buying headset made aliph. 
 box smells like cheap plastic burning electronics... i'm afraid plug thing iphone 4s... thing super cheap, thin metal alloy, poorly molded plastics, doesn't even ul certification...i'm guessing cost less 50 cents unit manufacture shows unfortunately... plus side box came looked nice 
 product looks solidly built. plastic feels velvety smooth. n85 doesn't charge that's nokia issue, usb device issue. ipod touch 2nd gen charges, tho. works.i thought going high vw jetta since sticks straight there's enough space stick whatever want charge.product works! mygearstore shipped quickly. fast prime 2 day fast enough.updated jan2012: 2 years, product stopped working. green light would flicker in/out. threw out. 
 stopped working. top works stoppes working every 10 seconds. makes phone go haywire. broke ford mustang's power slot prongs heavy duty large pulled slot out. buy. buy motorola micro use charger. good. 
 left eared. 90 degree turn fit ear bud turns wrogn way pops easily. sound form device decent, worth price hassel putting ear taking again. also earbud kept falling use. poor design. purchased many good reviews, i'm writting one.great sound keep ear keep falling apart you. total waste money. 
 like clean sleek look didn't last broke 4 weeks buy again... 
 wish give negative star!!! day came plugged car phone worked great min. unplugged threw glove box days go use - longer worked days sitting glove box. terrible. 
 charger worked great first, 5 months use died! light still comes won't charge anything. course return period ended 30 days, guess i'm luck. 
 used car. working, great. nice big blue light let know it's plugged in. chargers tiny lights visible one side. big transparent power indicator light seen sides.the design charger great. it's way fragile. plug issues 5 weeks got it, i'm looking another one (but obviously, motorola).i'm disappointed, thought motorola product would last longer. 
 charger worked well months stopped working. keep mind blue light distracting driving night. connected port back arm rest minimize light's distraction. 
 great price seems working lot people.but.. gps turned on, htc sensation samsung galaxy 4g either stayed current charge slowly gained little. stopped using weeks. look charger faster recharge rate (amps?) 
 nothing whether it's cheap knock off, primary beef charger, living couple years, bright blue light gives off. night it's hard ignore it, it's bright distracting driving. 
 original review "best mobile charger i've owned". even bought one girlfriend saw mine. now, less 3 months, failing. starts poor connection phone wiggle place certain position charge devolves able charge all. mine complete loss way out. one failed wouldn't give poor rating, failing together lets know inherent flaw design. i've disappointed excellent charger brief time worked. 
 product stopped working 4 months.amazon referred motorola 1 year manufacturer warranty.after calling motorola 6 different times (of course india call center) even emails (all responded to) told product stock tried send wall charger replacement . didn't understand product executing warranty car charger.still resolved. 
 doesn't work samsung s3... stops charging every seconds... try send back, words... still doesn't work 
 merchant claimed mailed item, never arrived. rather resending another, merchant finally agreed refund. good one stay away from, although finally refund money, guess gets couple points that. would think reputable merchant would suggested replacement option, none offered me. 
 worked awhile, maybe 3 months. stopped. kind review give something works well three months stops working? one star? 
 charger came bulk packaging. i've always leery chargers come way. it's big risk plugging s3 device could potentially knock off. here's beef, bulk packing stated anywhere description. gift? purchased charger directly amazon store there's really excuse this. 
 last long! sudden, stops charging. second one bought, thinking fluke first. recommended, unfortunately. 
 could give 0 stars would. item arrived plastic sandwich bag. charge phone. sent back. bought verizon charger works great. would recommend item. 
 ordered two first two work all, got two one spotty best got super hot plugged in. went verision store bought one actually works. 
 one died 3 weeks using new samsung nexus!!! wow, expected last longer... little upset... 
 four months trash, charge longer. contacted seller said, sorry 30 day window send back. ever hear 30 day warranty? garbage. guess get pay for. 
 ordered several time fate. micro usb plug end fails prematurely blue motorola light end adapter obnoxiously bright. bothered light adapter painted black, usb plug broke weeks later. i'm throwing away looking elsewhere. 
 excuse this. worked 9 months, like many things hassle replace less return. 
 cheap knock off. don't buy it. expecting one, like one came phone.the picture inaccurate. 
 product fit motorola phone. made flip phones. used newer style. 
 don't know i'm something wrong won't charge droid incredible. took five hour drive unplugged phone, battery completely discharged phone hot touch. 
 isnt micro usb chager regular usb charger send cheap adapter micro usb port falls really long waste money says nextel instead motorola dont buy! 
 worked great first- charged droid bionic quickly without issues. period time (6 months so) cord starts bending weird angle charge phone unless hold perfectly still (almost impossible moving car). 2 exact chargers suffered defect. would rather pay higher quality one replace every 6 months. 
 work new smartphones. smartphone said plugged doesnt work would slow charge. get modern smartphones. 
 stopped working exactly 9 months. bought good reviews. disappointed quality product. 
 charger work right package, gift. price great. found couldn't use it, took back try return. amazon said past return full refund.otherwise happy amazon. 
 found headset comfortable, excellent audio quality, times successfully connected nokia phones.after working blueant tech support trying two different phones, admitted known issue symbian os phones (most nokia smartphones) headset "paired" phone, connect reliably incoming outgoing calls. phrases used tech included:"[we] haven't got around compatibility issues symbian phones.""[this a] known issue."and apparently significant amount discussion blueant support boards (which could find call).not recommended symbian owners much would like to! 
 unit came right box rattling noise inside. would've kept bothering driving need turn head left right.also noticed didn't work pretty good paired two mobile phones simultaneously.it pretty small feels extremely comfortable, wish would've worked properly. 
 appears photo might sturdy items keep flash/thumb drives one handy place. nothing's truth. &#34;thread&#34; much thicker you'd use sew buttons ring led believe hold several items barely 1/3&#34; diameter. furthermore, actually put thumb drive ring, you'd need pair needle nose pliers spread ring apart, forcefully close back together. yes, cheap yes, several pack. $8.00 shipping (they come singapore), probably fashion better thumb drive holder using parts old key chains. far worst purchase i've ever experienced amazon...who ashamed selling trashy junk.the jokes me...i fell hype. don't let happen you. 
 first all, paid 78 cents 10 these. shipping all! would never trust hold weight cell phone. string thick fishing line. ring 1/4 inch diameter. loop big enough put three fingers thru them. bad investment 78 cents can't complain much. cannot recommend ever use them. far better lanyards much extra money. don't buy these!! 
 chose rating product never came. dislike help getting product. recommend one else buy person receive item. it's hard rate quality something exist. :( 
 hate fact wasted money product. 2 days 1 hour battery life. keep charger juice maybe 1 conversation, comfortable, flimsy. dont waste money. 
 read problem review bought thought fluke. mine little month plastic holds right speaker broke rendering headset useless. looks like return would replace another don't want keep replacing design flaw.sound quality great music. good want music headset answer phone call to. intend talking phone much back ground noise might one. 
 worth spending money guy ! worth spending time guy either !not worth spending money guy ! worth spending time guy either ! 
 iphone complete rip off, people know one don't even know got oter able say "hey got iphone". thing ipod touch basic phone functions.....more priced garbage crapple made rake apple fanboys money.....and fall it. 
 got sim card free promo item purchase cell phone, rates service really nuts, probably won't use it. 
 i've always bought international phone card i've traveled decided take phone one time try one sim cards. well, let tell you. made 45 minuets calls total 3 weeks overall bill $176. so, math, could spend $13 american dollars 10 euro calling card 400 minuets called hotel public phone....or $176 less hour calls. certainly worse choice made trip advise buy this! amazon.com, please consider taking list products...it misleading cost consumers way much money purchased. 
 read reviews carefully. ranking "high" may well-informed options -and comparatively inexpensive, easily available options!you'll need unlocked quad-band phone (available price ranges - sometimes buying one destination competitive price always) plus regular service sim, pre-authorized international use (call carrier go) use "just case" decide service use wherever you're headed. even dollar two per min "just case" call, service will, calls get local sim, cheaper. (or always text-message/sms, cheaper yet, even sim!) also pack good pre-paid international phone card, too, back-up (amt depending long you'll gone many countries you're jaunting - recharge this, too) call home something cell (which also get pricy).on arrival, purchase local-provider sim w/appropriate features (kiosks, local cell ph provider stores), add initial funds it. install ask so. buy pre-paid "recharge" cards needed; high-priced. found even e europe (every country) turkey - yes, higher per min contract, tiny percentage cost mobal cell ph! take minutes on-line explore regarding - glad did.i hope amazon withdraws offerings, truly do. 
 it's convenient, charges astronomical. even use handful minutes, you'd better purchasing prepaid card whatever country traveled to. warned, mobal ripoff. 
 chose card even though mediocre reviews one could find charged use, prepaid amount. went europe never used card/phone charged 3 text messages never got. $2.40 didn't fight error hard fact remains charged services rendered. further, $2.40 even got back 8 day trip. (emails got home already inbox) money, principle, don't like disingenuous companies. lousy $2.40 said sorry written off. would used card future trips trash now. 
 bought item forgot add unlocked phone purchase waste cannot use sim without giving credit card, means even want incoming calls still need register. plan pricing clear.also, phone number uk expecting us. 
 bought card took international trip. put card phoneand went site activate it, said put 19-20 numbers, therewere 30 numbers letters sim card. worthless. 
 charged battery use phone one hour. next morning wanted place call charge didn't hold. replaced older battery worked well. order oem again. 
 another plantronics blue tooth headset calls. works fine.i mainly ordered reading reviews iphone, - answer calls listen "acceptable" level bluetooth music.a) bluetooth music bad. sound tinnyb) use walking (not running, walking). music skips every step takec) stereo headset uses proprietary connector, can't use earphonesd) connector doubles earloop. although give earloops changing out, works mono earbud. use stereo headphone stuck single earloop.e) comes so-called usb charger, usb connector proprietary, non standard. means cannot use zillions standard usb cables/connectors you(i) lying aroundi would returned immediately, except "non-opened" items returned.choose product, one certainly work 
 worked great iphone3 nz-409 work iphone4... updates available useless...moving nz-500 unit built bluetooth iphone4 certification.... 
 know always risk buying generic, cheap, made china, stuff like this, ive actually pretty good luck cheap car charges like this. price, figured, id buy couple spares case one died.i ordered 3 retracting mechanism seems work well, two three simply work. tried two different cars two different phones. cases, red led lit up, cant fuse issue, neither phones indicated receiving charge chargers connected.the third one work, intermittently. connect it, leave cord fully retracted, charge. however, pull cord almost way, seems make connection charge phone.i know could probably return these, cheap are, worth hassle package pay return shipping. 
 purchased bunch since girlfriend tends destroy regular basis regardless build quality. bought similar chargers ok. ones however didn't work even right packaging stopped working uses. one left works half time. 
 micro usb side cable could never establish reliable connection device attached to, past week stopped working together. i've owned item well year; way soon cable stop working.i advise looking different company. 
 first off, rating 1-star can't leave 0. got phone iphone lack mms qwerty keypad iphone. boy, huge mistake. initially bought phone, week half major bugs started showing up. keypad text shows half time taking literally 10 minutes open programs. joke. then, started freezing badly way shut remove battery. time frame, downloaded anything could disrupted phone way. needless say, returned phone got replacement.the replacement phone great...for month half. that's issues first phone started happening again. phone, refrained downloading anything, period. say phone sucks big-time. 
 product merits 1-star due fact amazon censors well-cited reviews point deep flaws 'iphone killer'.it's nice faster cpu now, fancy qualcomm integration ati video hardware actually prevents video acceleration used, unlike predecessors, either nobody legally, capable (qualcomm), implement drivers, afford (htc). it's like getting nice, fast nvidia video card running computer safe mode.the phone actually take decent pictures, get pass sluggish, skippy, blurring display reminisces first gen digicams, well resolution reducing glare non-removable lens cover.heat issue device almost burn hand 3g wifi although it's nice display doesn't distort it, battery doesn't explode.windows mobile, os, isn't great still isn't great hardware. multitasks well end sluggish response running apps something background starts chugging cpu. graphics apis (such directx mobile) rely hardware acceleration, none phone, screen redraws sandwich making time, almost.think pda phone features, phone nice pim features. compared even palm's extremely outdated os, software os phone runs like sloth lacks polish apple ships phone.it nice phone allow flash new roms get past limited features ship (although video acceleration fixes), world traveler take phone use japan, europe, everywhere uses wcdma gsm, except t-mobile's/emobile's 1700mhz 3g network.unlike ace wireless gardena tell you, wcdma 3g allows voice data simultaneously. 
 actually never used why. finally got package folded half tire marks it. like mail man folded it, laid street, backed right top it, proceeded power brake burn top it. needless say screen unfixable creases barely still wrapper.it might good protector really probably absolutely nothing seller pretty steamed. 
 bought connect speakers tv. ok, guess $4.50 cannot expect much, dont expect last. cord really thin. make sure use minimum bending radiuses else feel like snap half.i also seem get 60hz hum leave extra cord laying around behind tv. associated power cords.first cord got sucked vacuum longer usable. ordered another metal connector broke off. looking different item time. 
 looked like great deal. boombox 1/8&#34; (3.5 mm) input external audio sources wanted use tablet computer couple portable devices. got distorted mono sound stereo sound 60 cycle hum depending far pushed plug. pushing way produced hum. tried number devices. results. guess internal wires connected right spots plugs. bought shorter, expensive cable works. buyer beware. 
 worked ok hour, starting making clicking noises cutting headphones. must shoddy product can't even work full day- returned them. 
 ear piece weak reception ,it don't filter sounds well,this poor product disappointed. 
 bluetooth woth buying. hurts ear bad take often. voice quality good person voice drops often. battery also bad. last long even full charge. never buy another motorola bluetooth again! 
 high hopes let hard. sounded like inside tin can. tried noise shield difference. caller end didn't notice effect removal background noise better favorite, plantronics voyager 510. big issue fit. ear loop slightly spring loaded keep mouthpiece sensor pressing cheek. intended allow sensor differentiate voice background sounds. problem spring tension ear loop slightly pushing headset ear. comes several ear bud sizes two ear loop sizes. tried all, ears. luck. held loosely slightest lean head side came. completely unacceptable far worse others i've tried. tested 8 different headsets. way tests pair two headsets, put one ear, switch call. even ignore fit problem (a deal breaker me) sound quality poor. worse caller bother, i'll stick 510. 
 lowest quality ever seen.i purchased cheapest got it. 
 bought bluetooth using another model plantronics bluetooth death. liked lot little bulky went slimmer model time; explorer 330. forget it! won't stay ear. makes ear sore hardly force wear (i job) get four feet away cell, get static. i'm disappointed model returning it. 
 cozip case simply case!!it protect iphones back thats it.cozip case protect phone breaking drops, schock all.its like case all.positive side makes iphone cooler stylish case protection,you extra careful phone,because drops! surely end expensive iphone.i recomend case style. 
 holy moly piece garbage! got cheapest/dumbest iphone case ever made! let begin:i iphone 4s 64 gig phone thing. wanted cheap black case it. wasn't concered protection whatever - something cover it. one looks good. look pics - looks nice, right? wrong!it's cheap piece bended metal/plastic. phone fits - kinda - sure doesn't feel secure! it's like rounded piece plastic - whereas phone, you'll observe - squared edges! part really bugged doesn't fit snug all: see main photo here? one see back phone? see apple symbol back phone lines nice flush back? lie! it's flush all! there's like huge gap back phone back case - feels terrible.most ports accessible thing - good luck using volume switches side iphone! can't. case rounded-edge thing going on, prevents fingertips getting side switches. dumb design!-seriously - know you're looking cheap case - ain't it! believe tell spend bucks get something you'll actually use enjoy. utter garbage! 
 really wanted work out! needed headset noise reduction could use car. callers can't understand i'm desk, car worse. made sure remove plastic covers upgraded firmware. many people praise audio quality, must lot variations units. know mine sucks. 
 tested unit 8 headsets worst sound quality, far. still can't beleive it! considering special features designed sound quality expecting best sound ever, oh well. way compared headsets pair two time, put one ear, switch call. allowed caller compare sound quality equally variety environments, ends call. tested headsets: jabra bt8040, jabra bt500, plantronics voyager 510, plantronics explorer 320, motorola hs850, motorola h700, jawbone, samsung wep200. problem sound quality caller bad could hardly understand word said. held unit inches front mouth could hear clearly ear. units tested go series background noise tests caller talking listening, case weren't able comunicate well enough get done. testing units went back tried one nothing seemed make difference. beautifull headset. looks great, feels great, great function fit, can't understand i'm saying there's point. man, i'm bummed! really liked one, too! 
 headset wasn't best quality - great me, talker, mic didn't work well. person end often hard time hearing talking quiet environment (forget car!). i'd recommend something else. 
 item gets dry-joint iphone side connection short weeks. you're stuck it. 
 ordered 2 item 2 theblack onesfrom 4 different sellers reading mixed reviews items. needed adapter pictured short plastic head male plug cord. none 4 received item pictured. reason needing iphone. fit inside tight spot back makita job site radio.without regular use ware tear, one sounded nearly identical tested music iphone 4s skullcandy in-ear headphones. audiophile, headphones inexpensive, adapters put stress yet.here's report adapter:white adapter received seller "cronuz" - 1 star:the cord feels flimsy. plastic used cord ends feels rubbery. experience iphone cases made similar material, suspect cord discolor and/or become dirty beyond cleaning doesn't break that.white adapter received seller "etech" (mailing label said "iflash inc") - 1 star:the item looks identical one cronuz. additional concern adapter can't get headphones plug without using lot force. force test sound quality, don't plan using cord again. also, 2 white adapters look identical, would think problem might encounter matter order from.black adapterreceived seller "eforcity" (not listing) - 3 stars:this adapter also flimsy cord. plastic male end slimmer fit tighter spot 2 white ones tested. hard plastic ends seem little durable ends white ones. believe get use one, wouldn't buy another one.black adapterreceived seller "elago design" (not listing) - 5 stars:first all, 5 stars based less $2. wouldn't say best adapter buy. however best one tested. cord stiffer feels solid others. female plug tighter fit play. plastic around male end slimmer rest. cord doesn't meet immediate needs longer plastic head, would buy use certain iphone cases block larger plugs.if order item don't receive pictured listed, contact seller. would rather give refund know shipping different brand listed. 
 shipping service terrible. don't expect receive order least 2 weeks. product feels cheaply made, like wire snap moment, all, work need 4 channels. 
 bought two help make keeping otter box case needed use speaker/aux cable.the first cable worked 1 hour began fray separate. second one gave audio one side. could pull cable slightly get channels (sides), gizmo (phone, tablet, mp3 player) moves slightest stops working sides.the bad thing static creates use (aux headphones).the item junk would avoid unless like throwing away money. 
 simply, product work. using makes sound muffled point it's almost inaudible. consider many reviews saying thing. heeded advice bought this. 
 things got bad reviews - ordered 3 sure got one good one (at least they're cheap). gave two stars instead one since, oddly, 2 3 worked intended purpose (a size adapter iphone), though none work plugged pc. hard imagine difficult product manufacture - assume manufacturer could simply care less...update: turns 2 star review way generous. 3 eventually stopped working properly. truly staggering level apathy manufacturer... 
 worked two months stopped working, well, works one side only, earphone get sound. 
 purchased item would work headphone plugged way...the sound muffled. worked fine headphone plugged 3/4 way. eforcity sent replacement charge unfortunately replacement doesn't work all. 
 give left right channels like should. music unbearable incorrect. buy this. 
 let use 2.5 mm headset. description represents accurately, time ordered it. 
 beware, get item pictured. get sort iphone recessed port adapter (kinda like belkin one) nearly good one picture.i gave mine away. hope prevents people getting ripped off.the seller even tried get recall negative comment promised refund. never received refund.tells kind seller you're dealing with. 
 purchased eforcity, us seller i've gotten items quality good price. case. item proper fit, fits bumper cases special cases would accept apple headphone jack (ie thin).but, first, getting audio one channel - jiggling bit cable base male end, 2nd channel started working getting static noise moving cable.audio would come go, briefly moving cable.filed claim damaged item. seems $1.70 drain. 
 looked like interesting relatively low-cost option wife's car/cell phone, since hasn't found bluetooth headset fits ear comfortably. unfortunately, cannot get unit pair three cell phones (iphone 3g, two new nokias). goes pairing mode advertised, none phones find (they find headsets computers tried pairing unit). makes rather useless, would strongly suggest testing phone one ordering.also disappointed lack usb ac charger. fault noticing comes car charger - convenient typically charge.no issues merchant - quickly shipped delivered fine. low rating speakerphone, merchant. 
 could barely heard using bluetooth device easy hear called. got progressively worse power level discharged. recommend product. garmin nuvi 660 better bluetooth audio quality. 
 bought use iphone 3gs. plugged in, got 'not iphone' charging message. sure enough, doesn't charge properly. problem that, even i've taken care make sure it's securely seated, won't consistently charge, there's telling certainty unplug phone morning, it'll charged.callpod charges old lg phone, husband's blackberry nintendo ds, flawlessly. adapter bust. haven't tried husband's ipod touch, can't say works device. 
 cheapest chargers ever purchased. work apple devices recognize authorized charger. pay get for. cheap price cheap quality. 
 bought set base lot reviews saying charge ipods. didn't realized kind ipod have, might 3g nano know won't work 4g nano. tried car charger, works play charge time. house charger doesn't. look label say compatible ipod 3g. however product description says compatible 3g, 4g nano, etc. bought enable charge without computer running. car charger important car long period time charging without playing. worth returning, postage cost items. 
 neither chargers worked ipods house -- ipod touch, iphone, ipod classics.it experience off-brand chargers sometimes actually charging even though charge light light sometimes item work wiggle connection throw salt shoulder attempting get work. nothing made work.i left item connected 8-24 hours, each, find ipods charged didn't. 
 bought "others" bought case purchased. one last minute "checkout" decisions. read reviews better. worked day received 4th gen ipod touch gives message charger isnt supported. reviews little scary. last thing want fry ipod. sure bother returning considering price. probably keep retractable cable toss chargers. 
 bought item.i receive 2 black 1 white.i buy supplier. 
 stopped working days. mishandling, rough use, stopped working, seems mfg defect. wont buy 
 within weeks plastic covering near plug ripped exposing wires two months stopped working. durable enough cell phone use. 
 piece never worked. headset works fine home phone wanted convert office. consistent pulsing hear every caller tells fading out. it's like bad corded bluetooth. 
 picture misleading - doesn't 3 stripes you'd need iphone - 2 stripes. doesn't work advertized. 
 maybe looked description wrong. doesnt work. perhaps dont realize many different types connectors size? problem seems stereo speakers wired together mono sound aren't?who knows i'm rewire it. bought simple ear piece/boom mic tried use droid. go me.your mileage may vary 
 tried use plantronics headset, mic wouldn't work. able hear side fine. don't order this, doesn't work advertised. one review mentioned worked perfectly purchased back 2008. person added onto review say changed something design problem adapter. heads buy disappointed. 
 bought charge old nokia phone couldn't find original charger came phone. charger worked fine first weeks decided stop working blue. idea happened wouldn't charge phone. throw saw point keeping something doesn't work. 
 complete cheaters. first all, charger never fit n73 phone slot. secondly, wrote 1st review criticisizing product, called saying send new replacement charger remove negative feedback amazon. waited almost 3 weeks charger never showed up. tried calling number got call, response.complete waste money, waste time useless product trash 10 minutes received it. 
 ordered oem blackberry headset months ago, & like one came storm, could tell difference & amazon seller bto inc.i placed another order wife headset, three weeks later & time offered amazon seller, "the oem shop" price. since stated oem item, placed order. received order, different first one ordered. original blackberry headset & first order, soft & flexible wire. one received "the oem shop" stiff & hard wire, flexible & feels going break folding it. think counterfeit blackberry oem one. never buy "the oem shop". worth send back. rating item:the original & one came "bto inc.", gets 5 stars.the one sold "the oem shop" gets 1 star. 
 adapters didn't last days daily use breaking. ironically failed strain relief male plug.when fail you'll see exposed wires male end break - way nice change adapters fail internally still look ok outside. 
 sure somebody screw simple audio cable extender cable, guys done it. impossible create solid connection inside iphone connecting headphone jack. everything snuggly plugged in, slightest rotation/jerk cable iphone produces hiss loss contact. goes headphone jack. it's like things made maintain continuous contact they're supposed contact. avoid costs. 
 sound one ear only. in-line remote controls don't work. mic functionality either. doesn't appear anything waste money.go radtech web site, you'll find similar product, except actually works properly. it's called procable shortz audio extender. unfortunately isn't sale amazon. 
 bought use p.o.s. credit card readers (most don't fit phone case on), made sure four-pole connector. although seller give full refund without question, cable didn't work cc readers have. 
 i'm sure long worked for...my girlfriend noticed pushed connection slightly, bass would suddenly get richer....tested nano iphone 4s. disappointing it's super-cheap cable so....i missed amazon claim window 2 weeks eforcity covers 30 days. companies would send replacement, questions asked, company not. buyer beware.note: connector fit iphone even case on, purchased begin with. 
 sent back immediately. one channels didn't work consistently, side also held microphone, didn't work either. worthless.five stars amazon return process, though--simple, easy, quick. 
 exactly looking - exactly looking - 
 bought one, broke 1st use. sent new one free one broke 2 days.. suction cup one device problem... think. idk would spend extra 10 get better one amazon drop 40 go apple store buy there.do buy 
 put window popped times think new stiff. wanted put kitchen washing dishes cleaning general answer phone hear music.. little nervous first fine.up date pops never got use couple times hr so, dont waste money time 
 case looked great snapped tight. minute snapped on, realized, needed remove microsd card phone, copy files put back. nearly impossible remove card centro without removing battery cover first (what clever engineer palm thought would good idea?!?!? definitely usability expert). so... hmmm.... yeah... eventually couple days later fearless friend mine pried open extremely sharp almost surgical quality blade. break it, said case survive open regular basis. - great case never need open battery cover. need open - look different case. 
 basically cheap plastic case.. want cheap... go it. case always unsnaps randomly good reason. somehow put right amount get unsnap. however, still easily unsnap case i'm glad phone hasn't fallen yet. swivel clip also hard press take phone... going fingers pushing ends clip order get phone clip. annoying trying answer call trying get text message. pro product it's cheap. 
 read reviews, would bought 
 item recommended piggyback purchase purchased plantronics voyager pro+ bluetooth headset. advertised desktop charging stand headset. apparently, it's base voyager 510 charger (the old, first voyager plantronics introduced, owned light-years ago technology time). pro+ fits awkwardly (tight fit) base come charger (although picture shows cord attached it). it's desktop weight voyager pro+'s charger fit. jam there, base sit flat rolls around desk. stand vertically. sum, it's rather expensive paperweight advertises plantronics. thanks nothing hope helps save money. 
 product bad joke! isn't charging stand all! simply plastic disc "supposed" fit hold earpiece. can't make function described mechanical engineer! come instructions all. arrived simple clear plastic bad nothing else. rate total waste money! 
 caution: get entire product usable device likely deal two, maybe more, separate vendors, shipments, multiple shipping charges, hard find specs tip fits exactly devices. one cares enough really help out. returns part(s) likely, add cost wait fully functional product. product, amazon sub-vendor system creates mess.i would avoid product like poison! 
 broke within minutes attaching phone clipping wat waistband. waste money. 
 ask money express shipping takes longer regular mail. took almost two weeks receive item. wrote seller seller never contacted me. 
 phone basic, little thin calculator. manual spanish menu options phone too. couldn't distinguish lower uppercase general dirt-cheap phone. would never recommend anyone. 
 mine lasted 4 days screen quit. reason sold warranty! wasted $40 one. 
 battery never worked. would hold charge. left plugged night battery never charged up. 
 really wanted work never charged phone 2 minutes. don't buy it. 
 used once. doesnt see charger unless push hard - do, use different charger, never charges. landfill. 
 bought hoping many stellar reviews would trump many poor reviews, unfortunately turned case me.i ordered item able charge new at&t; inspire 4g, htc. it's battery hog, portable recharge would great.i opened box, really excited product sexi look at... it's one dark black boxy electronics usually associate type product. it's curvy nice looking.initial read instructions proved challenge, it's clearly manual written chinese translated converted english north american sale. bit contradictory vague couple aspects, went online watched how-to, could say certainty using properly.i charged initially 24 hours (it recommends 4-6 hours), instruction manual came said one light flash completed charging. 24 hours, two lights still charging. went onto website states charging complete, light remain solid. however case me.i decided based specs, 24 hours enough charge (by technological spec 5 hours complete drain full charge take). plugged device, immediately 4 lights lit battery pack indicating full capacity. 5 minutes, dropped 3, 10 minutes went 2...at point contacted manufacturer. quick respond it's likely defective. questioned see lot said yes. asked don't resolve said (in broken english) people expect half price competition. seems bit odd response them. i'd want put best (usable) product price, put product, hey, whatever.bottom line: amazon issuing refund i'm sending one back. normally i'd give benefit doubt re-order another one, given less impressive response manufacturer, i'm planning returning refund. i'm going order zagg sparq 2.0, gets great reviews. almost 2x price, i'll suck pay it, suppose want product comes warranty support, that's cost it. also learned amazon doesn't lot flexibility marketplace seller practices, said hands tied. i'll stick ordering direct amazon going forward. :-( 
 unpacked plugged charger. second, third fourth led's lit up. seemed charging ok, external led laser light worked fine.after 30 seconds, led's went out, power button nothing matter many time long pressed, unit totally dead.back goes. glad spent extra $4 would time weekend trip. 
 gt product free, basically purchased larger charger received guy free gift. well, it's junk. device doesn't charge. plugged charge lights come seconds indicating charging unit shuts down. like many posters, mine probably defective. anyhow, advice avoid. 
 charger simply best. use iphone 5 works flawlessly. i'm getting almost 3 charges itorch needs recharged. never worry stranded dead phone. don't hesitate buy one!update 4/7/13 - unfortunately, spoke soon. enthusiasm purchased second charger shortly thereafter unit doa (would turn full charge). since still faith new trent, ordered third charger one also doa. 1 3 chargers performed expected. disappointed. 
 product works advertised, charging iphone full times one charge. really gives peace mind toward end day.update february 2014: broke 5 months use. 
 couple months use, battery wont charge waste money . . think waste money buy charger last 3months . 
 really loved first got it. charged well battery lasted long time. went charge second time would charge. know mine defective return mine. 
 product arrived read instructions charged battery recommended time. product work, charge. charged again, andthen issue. offered refund replacement. product book suspect. advised may go multiple purchases shippings order receive functional device. 
 would bother model. tried day two sounded like muffled waffles much syrup poured them!bluetooth connected disconnected randomly. sound solid, tinny.get sound matters speakers reviewed today want good solid pair speakers work last long time.sorry altec, blew one! 
 oh fits iphone mophie plus case -- perfectly! barely 2 weeks....the clip already torn case, nearly lost iphone 4s mophie air case, barely hanging threads. could give negative stars lack security case offered, would.so....not good investment....find something else!what else say....? 
 plastic clip first one broke day 2. figured manufacturer's defect, contacted seller quickly shipped replacement - questions asked. interestingly replacement metal belt clip. lasted month finally tearing poorly secured flimsy "leather" phone pouch.don't waste money. good products fit large phone (iphone4 mophie juice.) 
 looks like top button exposed pics. case ruin iphone. 2/4 iphone 4s top botton stopped working press hard. 
 well, get pay for, sometimes. wanted believe adapter going solve headphone jack problems, alas, ten minutes workout fallen completely apart wires detached. 
 first wouldnt even charge motorola cliq xt couldbe phone. wouldn't even turn one week. 
 work ipod touch 4g, dont know cause broken already box, leds dont work this?! garbage, dont buy guys 
 doesn't charge aa batteries case, actually drains battery device connected it. actually, fair, charges device 10 minutes, flow seems reverse, exhausts battery device it's supposed charging. threw recycling bin. 
 bought eneloop aa rechargable batterys..i began charge/play video mp3 player..within 5 10 mins picked charger..the charger stove hot, smelling melting..to think leave room while....scary situation..why make things thin plastic material?dangerous...... 
 researching ways boost cell signals found this. reading many reviews realized issue weak cell signals fixed, easily permanently, cell phone use wifi make receive calls text data. weak cell signal common problem concrete metal buildings shielding signals out. many live areas cell signals weak. always access wifi home office. republic wireless solved problem two years ago. uses voip calling backed sprint cell verizon roaming. also works world wide wifi $5 month. service unlimited contract. unlimited call text plan $10 month, unlimited cell, text data $25 month. use phone (moto x $299 moto g $149) need republic's proprietary software work rates. using 18 months worked perfectly. 
 work boost cell signal basement. exchange large office omni directional antenna. expected, amazon wonderful exchanging better model shipped right away. returns exchanges easy amazon never fear oredering always make right. 
 return meet application. home 3 stories, boost cell phone range well. 
 buy item really expecting first figure nearest cell phone tower house exactly direction? really planning climbing roof erect pole thing point directly cell phone tower? no, like you're thinking stick window increase reception. well won't. suggestion don't buy it; end returning way did. 
 give one pass. worked week two, suction cup quit sticking. poorly designed cup tension mechanism, holder came apart own. 
 two stickers, one protective screen one backing. stickers used separate protective screen backing. unfortunately sticker attached actual screen would peel off. leaves screen protector unusable. three screen protectors problem. 
 cool, searched screen protector especifically blackberry 8350i arrives, doesn't fit blackberry!!!!! pissed off, either sent wrong product advertised wrong. either way, didn't take action product cheap would cost price return it's much hasle.i still put screen even though doesn't fit (too big) amazingly still didn't fall looks transparent it's protecting. fit phone would've best product ever quality thing good.seller, you're reading this, deserve real 8350i blackberry curve screen protector.thanks. 
 protecting screen bb curve past 3 yrs. custom cut long universal plastic screen protector. change, order product dismayed it. good side a.) tiny cleaning cloth; b.) 100% exactly size bb screen. bad side are: 1.) can't re-applied mess-up; 2.) one 2 tabs said "please peel mask application" harder remove. paste dried signifying old stock.it faster satisfying cut old way. odered 5 pieces (5x3 =15)and would take awhile finish off. wasted 2 already initial application. first trash-out cause would stick re-alignment. second, used wet napkin remove dried paste leave scratches new screen protector dried paste can't removed all. attempt remove dried paste, bigger area spreads sticky mess.it's worth returning throw away go back old way it. 
 good. used handful times *light* duty charging phone. using 5 times, received red fault light. plugged couple times cigarette lighter see problem resolves, blew fuse car. buy brand again.company would stand behind product - told contact amazon, b/c 30 days, i'm luck. 
 recently received battery, immediately noticed suspiciously looked "used" (it deep marks scratched ends) doubts ... but, wanted give benefit doubt went ahead charged use.it appears new battery holds charge "stand only" (with calling all) four days (and good 3g area) ... new battery supposed last "up to" 10 days stand only. battery received better old worn battery trying replace. would advertise "new" battery obviously used? fact, old battery looks newer one.maybe order ... but, seemingly false advertising, cannot recommend. 
 bought 5 cables 3gs reading many reviews none working. say accessory supported everytime plug in. useless 
 original usb charging cable two years never problem. recently wanted extra cable bought one. less three months started show problems... charging constantly interrupted move cable bit would start charging again. today working cable completely ripped apart.it may cheap definitely worth last 3 months. better go apple store buy original one. 
 cable doesn't work, sure got bad cable something soon put nothing happen won't work wall pc, good thing cheap would really piss. 
 dont trust it, failed week like every knockoff purchased. get good brand name tape something never lose. 
 every time plug called "product" iphone 4, says "impossible charge device". something like that. reason buying it?! another disappointment... 
 whenever plugged iphone 4s cable would charge disconnect within seconds finally stopped working together. another iphone accessory wasted money on. makes sense buy accessories apple. it's money, it's worth it, least they'll work. 
 order 20, 30 pin apple cables none work devices, computers power supplies. good price, well good product worked, probably less return postage. 
 got pack 5 cables knowing original apple cables original replacements. knowing know issues come cables, disconnect pulling cable instead connector tend fall apart problem allways remove connector pulling cable, however cheaply made even care stop working. 3 5 cables dead now, havent used 2 one falling apart joint dock connector due natural twist cable. two even get recognized device longer even though cable looks perfect shape. wiggle cable eventually connect moment touch device drop connection. 
 save money. two things shorted out, fortunately devices weren't garaged. cables cheap rubbish, really! 
 fit iphone 4. cheaply poorly constructed. really duped sale recommend others buying item except directly apple. 
 weak poorly made. would better spent little money purchased expensive cable would worth time money so. 
 purchased four stop working spit end cord,one plug apart 
 bought 2 stopped working within month. didn't spend lot money obviously something wrong them. 
 unplugged first time came apart. paid cheap got cheap. even worth time comment 
 bought two within month head come loose wire cover exposing wires. basically fell apart stopped working. went monoprice got iphone cables cheap high quality. 
 got pay for. got inexpensive wires fin work ipad 2. use devices work purchased for. 
 bought ccceaccessories 1 penny. guess get pay for. fell apart one week minimal use. bought 3rd spare cable fiancee, broke quickly. 
 skeptical read great reviews. works charge sync. take good care cords anticipate issues.april 2014. ordered another one doesn't work all. 
 particular brand didn't last month. try find another brand. good though. 
 read update!as always, apple cord shorted need another. great, cheap, working replacement charger!update: literally hours later cord won't sync computer. charges. can't get around all. also, cord hard get port port. cheaply made. save money buy cable! 
 materials design nearly durable ones come phone. delicate easily broken. ordered 2 1 didn't work all. 
 bought 20 these, figuring lasted couple months each, i'd years worth cables. ones i've used barely made week. one car lasted two uses... one gave away lasted less couple hours... understand cords provided different companies, may better others. company bought ships hong kong. emailed issue heard anything back them. clearly waste money time. i'm &lt;$20, i'll consider cheap reminder get pay for. two apple cords still kicking years use, whatever cost, assume it's worth extra amount. 
 matter cpu usb 2.0, 3.0, even usb plug adapter item still non functional tries connect hear & see signs never makes it. went microcenter purchase one there.after taking apart modifying wiring got work using lower gauge high quality copper wires. 
 item looks virtually identical original apple cable, iphone 3gs tells "charging supported accessory". don't know phone tell difference, likes charged original. able use retractable type cable months quit working. price, can't complain. 
 cord least 1 long, 12&#34;. even good price doesnt save bad product. call company -it's &#34;oh we're sorry - it's stock - thats sent short ones.&#34; 
 buy this. apple certified. pay get real cord. dad burnt drive iphone using non apple certified cords, don't risk it. 
 better buying true product apple store stead... total waste money. won't connect many things stuff connect won't keep charge going long. awful! 
 things terrible! least ones got "itemsforless". cord pulled phone end.come amazon get "sellers" web site! it's getting bad e-bay. 
 waited almost 2 months product finally got it, didn't even work. worst dollar ever spent. :( 
 price great reviews mixed. took chance ordered two cables. ends connect iphone completely alignment cables! contacted seller thought try get work. possible way going take chance damaging iphone. seller sent two cables better. contacted seller refund wanted return cables. makes sense spend amount refund shipping defective cables back seller! warned -- buy! product waste time money. 
 yes, cheap, thought hell ill buy it. cord worked week randomly stopped able charge phone lol dont waste ur money, takes like month shipping 
 never buy another cord sellers...they break don't work start. claim apple certified none are! 
 cord took almost month get finally get it, work!! guess get pay 
 made mistake purchasing charger cord.as soon connected iphone 4 charger, started overheat within 5 minutes, charger cable burning hot.the bottom line price chargers ring alarm bells! learned lesson.stay away buy genuine apple charger instead!the adapter, however, charge iphone4. receive &#34;charging supported accessory&#34; connecting. 
 got ipad cable didn't receive one! totally forgot one. knew something missing didn't realize remember got email. 
 rarely used begin with, won't even charge work all. it's frustrating. 
 purchased 6 extra chargers car, office home. within 1 week none would work. quit first time tried using them. poor quality waste money time.. better charger. tried contacting seller reply!!!!! 
 don't mind buying non-apple parts, advertised apple oem parts, turn cheap chinese knock-offs, disappointed. bought 3, even uniform. even usb logo opposite side one plug. grind nail file make fit bumper iphone 4. ok price, giving one star selling counterfeit instead simply saying 3rd party cables. 
 i'm sure it's apple actual chord eventually chord stops charging idevices, iv'e noticed ipad ipod. it's says "this device supported"it took month fir message occur devices i'm sure it's waste money. 
 okay changed comment this. thought dad said worked, didnt charge dads phone. really disaponted :/ 
 first time got it, working. company nice sent another. however new one broken well fell apart within seconds. 
 first all, shipping took long, forgot ordered them. looked good first, kind got excited extra two cables didn't remember ordering. plugged first one iphone 4, connection snug. problem right? sync finished, went unplug, except wouldn't unplug. used pressure, cable disintegrated, situation raw wires coming (see one pictures description). worried getting electrocuted not, eventually got connector phone using pliers.second cable, thing. cable snug, cheap.these cables absolutely worthless. 
 fine one week stopped working completely. bought twp thinking would work perfect long time, useless. 
 stopped working 2 weeks, tells compatible phone. worked 1 week. 
 bought two usb cables. thought i'd give whirl. took receive them, turns neither work...don't waste time money.

 item ordered boho tronics ($2.75). apple product knockoff possibly reject. took almost 3 weeks come. doesn't work. won't sync charge ipod touch. reordered pricemasters ($3.19). reordering realized may also turn knockoff reject. i'll wait see. possibly vendor first (different name) vendors use knockoff supplier. it's inconceivable real apple cable ($19.00) could sold $2.75.amazon allow device described "by apple" it's apple.--------------------------------------this follow above.the order pricemasters ($3.19) arrived today. one doesn't even fit ipod touch. won't force fear damaging unit.save money try one griffin ($14.15)[...]at least return amazon refund.or still betterspend full $19.00 go directly apple. 
 used one week (if that) thought great, charge apple products. garbage. 
 piece junk waste time money. sure got away selling garbage! 
 worked times charge iphone. stopped working would charge phone. 
 cable's external insulation separated connectors, sides cable (phone-end mac-end), within one week. left internal wires exposed. junk, junk, cheap junk. 
 received cable when/how described. but, pluged cable computer charge phone, unpluged it. usb portion cable, stayed computer!never again! 
 charger worked perfectly fine 3 days, certain position. two weeks, stopped working. buy waste money 
 day got using charge grandsons ipad fell part end plugs ipad came apart buy anymore sealer cheap made worth money waste sorry. 
 cable work, however material made poor quality. end connects phone rips easily.and also, end connects phone little thicker apple cable. wiggle cable it's plugged doesn't slide well apple cable. you're better spending little buying genuine apple cable. last lot longer.. 
 don't buy it. cord longer apple one, seller lies say's is, syncing problems. 
 iphone cable needed replaced wires exposed. noticed starting come apart days ago decided order one. relieved received today cable really thrown replaced. i'm afraid fire something. plugged in, disappointed find didn't charge phone. tried different outlet tried usb port laptop. nothing worked. sending back amazon find one store continue charging phone. 
 great charger first day broke next day sucked really needed charger one broke !

 every iphone connector seems break wires comeout within month two i'll buy another one like $5 less, suck. 
 purchased cable nathan norris. please, please please save money buy cable. mine stopped working little month. unfortunately, i'm outside timeframe returns i'm stuck usb cable that's completely useless.save money, don't buy! 
 beware buy from, many vendors there, seem version another.i ordered one vendors vendor actually sent older style, release clasps (for old ipod classics video), it'll work, however, ordered, another thing learned studying connector:it's shoddy quality... center ground blades apple's proprietary-side, coming apart, point?look, probably spent $300+ ipod touch iphone, cheap-out shoddy cable possibility ruining connector?connector 101 - takes two connectors mate, one destroy mate. i've decided fork dough apple get genuine one, least that's made tolerance good.buying various sellers random crap-shoot, cheaping buying knock-offs chance destroying little mobile investment...i would stay far away these. i've learned lesson, luckily, vendor gave full refund ($1.50 woohoo!), said, vendor probably knows his/her products questionable best... 
 first cable seem work well short period time quit working... taking apart see why. solder connections horrible... really surprised poor connection. like cheap cost charge bit cables right. 
 inexpensive barely work. attracted price tough make function kids phones. 
 work first 30 days,i brought two, one broken, line disconnect 20daysthe one works ok first couple times,after 30 days still looks prefect, suddenly plug pc, nothing shows up, became working1 dollar 20 days, depends u thinki never buy it, cause might work suddenly u really need charge ur iphonethos previous reviewfvery nice price, works well.i buy two got it. usb good also fast shiping

 worked 3 days never worked again. disappointed product. would recommend anyone all. 
 always proponent bluetooth headset use, especially talking cellphone driving time. think unfortunate certain people consider using bluetooth uncool somehow associated rather hateful stereotypical image hummer-driving yuppie. you're driving talking, get bluetooth headset! would rather see people driving around road like telephone tech supports blind distracted zombies. ends rant believe everyone using wireless headset. let's talk plantronics discovery 925 bluetooth.i've gone bluetooth headsets past years - mostly motorola jarba models priced around 20 bucks. absolutely complaints regarding economy models. received 150 dollars headset(!) mail, seriously expecting awed shocked level performance, feature, luxury previous unexperienced.the unboxing setup process pretty straight forward. one fancy feature indeed useful leather carrying pouch included, isn't plain leather pouch either. carrying pouch, fact, built-in battery. headset stored inside pouch, plug charging cable charge headset charging pouch. later on, you're road, fact two batteries ready used greatly extends hours use charging. unfortunately, charging carrying case positive thing say headset.according manual packaging, headset supposed fancy audio-processing logic make phone conversation crystal clear. alas, case. got headset bonded verizon krzr phone made test call wife, voice sounded rather dull, down-sampled, somewhat metallic. unacceptable 150 bt headset! honestly say, term voice clarity, previous 20-buck motorola/jarba outperformed ridiculously overpriced headset far. tried headset cell phones. motorola krzr rather common handset, plantronics 925 gave quite let-down.in conclusion, recommend headset anyone current price. around $30 - $40 (currently amazon already offering 50% original listing price), looks/design important voice clarity, perhaps recommend you.sorry plantronics, honestly, genuinely wanted love headset. time being, i'm going back 20 dollar jarba. 
 really don't clue say comes three different sized ear buds. buds close size could barely tell difference. tried three them, single one small enough ear none would actually considered "in-ear" ear bud me. also simple chore swap out. also learned lesson (which suspected anyway) cannot use headset doesn't something goes ear help hold head. case actually pretty stupendous, though. would love headsets came case like one. 
 one worst bluetooths i've had. thought i'd try price saying goes, &#34;you get pay for&#34;. 
 bluetooth four days. worked perfect, paired easily, sounded great.then sudden, stopped working. wouldn't recharge, wouldn't turn on...it nothing. 
 first read reviews m1100 925 plantronics. believe 5 star reviews fake. amazon. see 5 bad reviews bad device coming amazon.. bought m1100 first full static conversation. sent back day bought it.. amazon gave gift card refund. ordered 925. one worst m1100. bluetooth hold static without phone. got like five minutes ago. also sending one back..... everyone grown going want do. im saying dont dumb waste lot time..... reviews fake... ordered m1100 925 plantronics.. love static ear two you.... 
 plugged computer, whole computer turned off. powered on, received message bios: "usb device current status detected" shutdown 15 seconds. i'm running self-built computer 900w power supply, 1 usb device connected.out curiosity, tried another usb port (on back) - result. also, result toshiba laptop. also tried usb wall charger have, produced electric arc. obviously, doesn't work. i'm glad didn't damage hardware.see find better quality product - one junk. 
 battery arrived within time frame shipping well packaged.the first visible difference original cell one made china; original made korea.the original solid, one seam around bottom, one could see battery's contents starting leak already. manufacture code dc061128 (november 28, 2006) means battery 5 years old.the battery come full charge, battery that's already leaking isn't going used phone. since cost nominal, it's worth bothering return it.rating: 
 headset cancel outside sound. also isn't loud broke broke couple days got it. cheaply made! 
 update: reviews state - thing snap 2 normal use. don't buy this! sounds great, break normal use short while. samsung's "warranty" doesn't cover obviously defective design - well, someone sue language written warranty covers defects surely defect see many people problem!since samsung won't stand behind - i'm boycotting samsung products - go!and, here's "repair" them:gorilla glue: really good gluea piece flexible metal - looked around parts box found sort bracket - strip thing metal, cut bit big. bent cover top bottom band gorilla-glued it. 24hrs, put black duct tape around repair job it's lasted several months. actually cut small part broken band near snapped thin face wanted slightly tighter/snugger fit - that's i've got now.the headphones still uncomfortable wear hour others said dig ears, like gym around home bluetooth headset voice calls phone. can't wear hour time.[final?] update - sep 2010: keep breaking new places. sixth break headband today, i've given trying repair it. so, found pair headphones longer use (traditional over-the-head band), took earpieces off. used gorilla glue blue samsung earpieces on. now, fit comfort issues gone - won't break either. but, cable 2 earpieces isn't long enough - so, right put behind head... thinking cutting wire 2, splicing/sodering piece cable go around band over-the-head - altho require skill wires inside cable thin. 
 units - 2 them- would sync work laptops. returned via amazon printed ups label 7 weeks ago. still wating refund. amazon says cant refund charge, merchant.guess, file dispute amx. 
 dont buy it. waste money. back cover kept coming out. know sent back never got money back. waste time money. 
 nice looking phone.if phone problems, motorola agents unavailable help way except offer maybe repair sent in, cost unlocked version.find company supports products, either number one, wants be. want android, several companies hungry biz. motorola not. 
 recieved time back cover broken asked another one sent pink cover seriously wth hone self stop working within weeks horrible dont wwaste money time ith people unprofessional. 
 mom missed razr phone got her. but, got excited opening realized cheaply put together felt brittle hands. don't recommend unless like crappy cheap phone backup. 
 going return phone stay charged hour, that's problem far unable use extended time see issues. 
 i've used many igo products first one disappoint. doesn't fit 12v outlet (cigarette lighter) well comes loose time. devices run charge think they've charging.so product fails it's one purpose: charge stuff.i still love igo products i'm still happy igo 12v chargers own--just one. 
 check reviews amazon.com, hundreds. one them, despite traumatic experiences few, ever received one star.that's changing today.i received stylus stoked try sketchbook mobile. soon turned iphone though, "what heck; let's try menu screen navigate app." pushed stylus gently, nothing work. pushed little harder, seemed get iphone working. opened sketchbook, nothing happened. pressed harder, still nothing. pushed even harder tried draw, stupid stylus scratched screen. it's little nick screen protector, i'm worried.i read push harder get working screen protector, pushed way result shown.i'm returning stylus a.s.a.p. amazon.com.my guess one-star review--ever. read others precautionary reviews, thought exception.i wrong. 
 stylus cheap quality press harder screen use iphone ipod. get pay.don't waste time money. 
 supposed work phone, doesn't. purchase product lg gu295 slider phone. may cheap uses micro usb wont work phone. 
 buy. threw away. overheats plugged point hard touch it. 
 loved everthing headset stopped working less 3 weeks received it. disappointed threw away box nothing. worked, fantastic stylish. disappointed. 
 headset purchased wife. biggest problem months, wouldn't hold charge. tried everything get work right, avail. finally gave & disposed it. 
 i've purchesed s9 volume cellular received item promissed. days usage, device started problems controlls. within week, device dead! contacted seller, advised situation, seller helpful providing assistance, options including refund. even encountered problem returning device ups, seller promply refunded money upon receival. stated earlyer, greater service, bad product motorola!! maybe bad luck device. well buy seller, another s9 head set. 
 looking discrete bt earphone worked ok. important thing portability discrete - look like nerd streets.my objective listen podcasts... worried sound quality.well, thing needed work right blue-tooth transmission.... doesn't !! works inside home inside car. i'm street doesn't work anymore (i live big city lots radio interference). bring phone really close earphone order bt work without interruption.when say doesn't work = music plays 2 seconds pauses 2 seconds, plays bit pauses bit more... it's bad connection noise. stops transmitting altogether.the funny thing phone conversations, work anywhere. i'm listening music podcast, doesn't. think stereo mode takes bandwidth requires better transmission rate.... possible interference... whatever reason - it's worthless, unless interference-free zone.ahhh.. fitting. good. big head, even me, earphone loose fitting. need press ears hands snug-fitting easier hear.do waste money !!i used htc tytn ii phone windows mobile 6.0 try product. 
 awful product! first received it, skip/back function work, could skip tracks headset advertised. volume low, even maximum device headseat volume levels. headset exposed even little moisture, either: randomly increased decreased volume (with insane "beep" every 1/2 second) stopped functioning altogether. made headphones useless jogging/workouts yard work - even little bit sweat screwed up. rubber ear pieces fell third use. finally, range horrible - unit cut constantly cell phone holster waist. wear arm holster unit would range. compare 2 foot range 40+ foot range another bluetooth device, headphones don't measure up. suppose would suitable sleeping phone next bedstand (and sweat sleep!)... thank goodness $50 instead $100 asking retail stores. 
 bought use jogging works half time. difficult use consistently definitely regret buying since i'd rather paid something dependable. 
 would purchase product internet. ordered one, recieved it, wouldn't even register charging, didn't get test it. called amazon, great. representative kind quickly sent replacement item overnight. opened one charge. trouble pairing phone, eventually that. tried use it. put "on" position, turned off. put "off" position, turned on. even took brick mortar store make sure wasn't missing something. purchase one store, h710, next model up, say like it. works great comfortable ear. also seems bit quality discrepency two virtually identical items.the one purchased store lot less "plasticky" one ordered on-line. seems less-than-coincidental recieved two row malfunctioning significantly. 
 charger charge rapidly, it's normal charger. also bulky top charger, bulkiest i've seen years, it's hard fit things outlet power strip next it. self favor skip 
 honestly didnt notice phone charging faster....seems like jus regular phone charger...says motorolla dont know, could fakey rip off...its workin like regular charger, impressed 
 product work box. plugged phone tablet. go. avoid. 
 ordered item already 5 motorola mini-usb micro-usb working well earlier order another company. one arrived noticed two phones (a droid global 2 lg) would work (i ordered 5 these). adapters molded plastic id skn6252a. ones work look little better built 97 mm versus ones don't work 85 mm. hologram trademark, suspect ones work counterfeit. least cheap. 
 motorola thought would really good, didn't last two weeks connection started going bad. wiggle micro usb end keep charging light phone. mini usb cords/chargers don't problem them, it's port phone. 
 don't waste money work u get them, quickly break and/or mess phone u try use it's plugged in. doesn't work u try use computer transfer data like photos, etc. i'm disappointed b/c purchased 4 since went cell phones micro usb charger mini usb chargers & seemed like waste throw old cords away. knew taking risk looking reviews, decided chance & struck out. advice even gamble working. 
 reviews, seemed little adapter magic. however, tried multiple mini cables chargers none would allow charge mifi novatel. 
 bought several stopped working within 2 weeks receiving them. would returned them, time would gone post office, paid postage, waited come back, wasn't worth time money. don't buy. 
 fit materials ok, holes cut poorly look like someone pocket knife, strip silicone one seam, like mold wasn't properly formed. result appearance product embarrassingly bad. save money, go one better made...perhaps made rim. 
 bought product knowing reviews gentle it, problem even though red light lights up, never worked. cheep. worth returning 
 i've wilson fan since days manufacturing hf yagis love wilson sleek. decided upgrade gain antenna increasing signal strength. however, antenna shows zero improvement little zero db gain spike comes sleek. guess rg174 higher loss thicker cable comes spike antenna counteracts gain antenna. 
 seller neglected state antenna doesn't work alone. idea needed buy separate receiver work. sold together. 
 purchased blueant z9i headset based rave reviews submitted reviewers. unfortunately, personal experience blueant nothing short total disappointment.first off, little history. years, used old logitech bulky trusty "logitech mobile freedom". trust me, besides bulkiness fit, great battery life decent reception sound quality. better wind resistant most. favorite plantronics voyager 510. far, itis best sounding trustworthy bluetooth headset. still using today. like look fit works fine. gripe easily picked ambient noise wind noise noisy environment kill performance. quest ultimate bluetooth headset, purchased plantronic voyager 815 disappointment.i also used bluetooth headsets various brands nokia motorola.when read rave review blueant noise cancellation technology, jumped opportunity. boy, disappointed receiving parties kept telling lot noise (regardless adjusting position) background voice sounded tinny. volume headset also low side.since then, moved jawbone ii jawbone prime. 
 product 9 months. matter fact 2. sound clarity fine even walking around noisy areas. problem ear piece. one ear piece post broken second one rubber gel earpiece started separating post. blue ant wants charge $20 two replacement ear gels. ludicrous new blue tooth $60.update: i've return order. realize best choice. blue ant sent retail package. pieces padded envelope. fine initially since refurb. although, someone pack wrong charger package. return dept. stated sent pieces back upc code retail packaging....huh? don't think guys know doing.i need find better product. 
 got 4 sale, shortly state mandated handheld phones car. chose brand based solid year's use another blueant bluetooth speaker bought another person gift.right away, one speakers wasn't ever working properly. weeks later, mine stopped working. 2 probably aren't getting used, wife doesn't use phone lot mom probably let battery die. won't get feedback those.they paired right away worked (mostly) line. since 2 4 bought either failed stay paired paired simply quality connection can't recommend product hesitate recommend brand. 
 got really like it, load iphone phone book support blue ant sucks. want send testing instead new one. don't buy it! 
 get pay for. purchased friend lost friend. realized i'm type person buys cheap crap hoping perform. thing never held charge. connected plug, sure, worked nicely enough. what's point wired bluetooth?? 
 us android tablets. wish noticed got , sent back obviously.i would think would want ti make tablets capacitive screens, 
 i've stylus month worked well first now. tip dirty looking takes pressure get respond also leaves many smears screen fingers do. i'm sure tip cleaned. would avoid stylus unless want one disposable. 
 first, unit operating normally, lowest volume setting loud factor 2 good you're hard hearing. you're not, headset probably damage hearing longer notice.secondly, unit spontaneously stops working. becomes necessary disconnect battery twice. tried replacing battery that's problem. result accessing battery many times cheap plastic cover eventually loosen refuse stay attached unit. 
 second unit crooked band around neck fit ear well. use late return defective product came like that. 
 rated charger two stars takes long second battery charge. two external chargers plugged spare batteries captivate battery charged much faster infuse battery (they completely new & needing full charge). works however taking 7hrs fully charge spare batteries. ok 4 days charger work. blinks like charging extra battery place phone charged all. disappointing dropping 1 star star possible! 
 iphone 3g user. love iphone. cheap motorola h375 bt earpiece worked fine except wasn't comfortable ear fell easily. sounded good though.i used blue ant speakerphone. great! great battery life worked perfectly right day "buzzed" died. got lot usage left favorable opinion company even though went kaboom one day.i self professed gadget freak. ok, said it.when saw blueant v1 bluetooth headset read it's features knew me. initially expensive saw amazon $79 figured couldn't go wrong.rofl!okay, always try give new gadgets fair trial recommending friends clients giving it. using blueant v1 bluetooth headset exclusively since december 2009.it simply frustrating bluetooth earpiece ever used! 3 weeks turned voice prompts & speech recognition. announces callerid incoming calls it's seems take forever finish wants say answer phone.if earbud isn't perfectly aligned ear tick people call answer can't hear anything saying. especially prevalent car. (2003 ford expedition eb, somewhat quite car)it really trouble coordinating things iphone 3g. calling out, problem, uses earpiece fine. go answer call... much, selects iphone manually select blueant v1 bluetooth headset iphone menu. okay get bunch replies, yes try "this that". didn't work properly consistent inbound calls.okay, this, still continued try blueant v1 bluetooth headset given it.perhaps put bookshelf marvel technology allows functionality small form factor. guess i'd amazed actually worked.pros:comfortable stays put ear.volume level decentgoog-411 built hard coded speech recognitioncons:it sucks.poor audio fidelitynot iphone friendlyit sucks.battery life good.really bright blinking on. (this deactivated likes come back on)it sucks.in case wasn't clear, would recommend product anyone.i hope find review useful read reviews purchase products, like new bluetooth headset going buy now. let research begin!~e 
 i've unit three days. product suffers glaring problems:1. painful wear. earpiece cover made hard rubber. foam. soft rubber. using smallest three covers ear bruised. could wear plantronics bluetooth hours; one agony minutes.2. on/off button located underneath flexible skin unit. hair-trigger. disconnected numerous calls trying adjust jawbone's position volume touching outer skin unit way hangs call.3. sound quality horrible. fair marketing hook unit microphone technology. saved research money speaker. sound tinny garbled.keep looking: unit answer. 
 jawbone may perform admirably far technology. generally don't care much, sports car, trying avoid loud environments i'm conference call.my issues unit simply doesn't work well. i've tried different tips, including available free additional tips none stay ear. jam thing slowly works way course couple minutes. since button external body unit, try press back end hanging call. great idea button anything. similarly try turn thing on, hold "button" you'll find thumb covers little red/green light tells whether not. stupid. 
 don't buy it!! ear hooks seemed break month wearing... wait came w/ 3 4 additional....but wait buy wait would want thing would shut w/out waring unable saty connected phone!!!! wow god thing amazon reasonable price get hosed price retail store!!! buy plantronics m50 - bluetooth headset!! look amazon it!!!!l.s.thomaswest chester,pa. 
 aliph jawbone ii farce. tested calling several people nobody hear well. said sounded far away, even though volume it's maximum. fit comfortable all. tried every single earbud earloop. vas button can't make contact face, unit useless. press face (face skinny?), point wearing headset need use one hand operate hand steering wheel? safe imho. 
 really wanted like headset. purchased it, thought small, unobtrusive, blinky-blinky lights, subtle professional. blogs yammering "military-grade noise assasin" technology made think couldn't go wrong.wrong.after purchasing it, couldn't get stay ear, tried many (i got bored dozen) iterations ear in-ear adjustments. willing tolerate falling ear time, served primary function.but didn't.people kept saying couldn't hear me, background noise intolerable (so much noise assassin). also, whenever tried pressing jawbone ear could hear better, pushed disconnect button ended call.ooops.and paid early adopter price at&t; store; nearly $150 shipping.my bad.don't repeat error. good product. 
 bought aliph jawbone ii bluetooth headset noiseasssassin black hated work like suppose to. 
 jawbone ii bluetooth headset really made well lot worse people seem give credit for. parts fall short time cheaply made.further, set up, use one ear. headsets (like plantronics ones example) allow swivel earloop switch ears get tired using one ear. jawbone doesn't this. order switch ears, remove earloop reinstall it.while jawbone's noise cancellation seem good that's going voice still sounds muffled, soft digital-like.but main complaint aliph jawbone company customer service itself-they absolutely horrible. advertise website jawbone 1 year manufacture warranty end consumer. but, jawbone broke contacted getting warranty service it, rudely informed provide warranties units bought directly website. bought retailer, zero warranty! i'm sure whether even legal, believe reflects poorly company don't even stand behind products.i would never recommend buying headset made aliph.a much better choice would theblueant z9i bluetooth headset (black)because:-it doesn't require unit touching jaw bone cheek all-it's lot easier put take off-it's comfortable doesn't fall easily-it' two selectable levels noise cancellation-it's firmware update-able-it wind noise suppression-it's cheaper yet audio quality callers same. noise cancellation equal-it full 2 year warranty 
 purchased product work noisy environment, thought would trick. worked fine far noise reduction, fails design.i problems getting used fact didn't need raise voice heard phone. i'm shout someone 5 feet away, speak normally phone. hard get used to, working it!this device though, extremely painful wear length time. part behind earpiece, rides cartilage ear nice sharp, pointy corners get painful couple minutes. tried combinations earpiece & hangar without success. would tried jabra ear gels others recommended except one issue.i use headset occasional device, seems designed worn times. want device turn want on, own. power button extremely easy depress turn on. carry pouch belt, pressure pouch turning it. try answer incoming call, find gone device instead phone.in summary fits good, you're going wear time, great device, especially noisy environment. 
 2 first generation - wonderful. new jb comfortable. clarity lacking noise reduction seen good. callers end always complaining poor quality. total reset several times due total deterioration sound. 
 horrible device - purchased 3 various sources - one amazon - guess 2 three broken - one joint behind holder - one devices jaws came open driving dropping expensive device.just poor buying using experience. 
 i'm honest people... complete utter junk! things never purchased this. rush jumped bad item. phone different give tip: get something mount dashboard double side white foam tape. however, don't install middle dash. possible fix drivers left side corner dash. line sight distractions.as thing... shakes, rattles, makes kinds noise weight smart phone much it. 
 thought $8 good deal, uber-cheap! spring-loaded vent clips attach top unit, thicker vents jeep cause pop occasionally. also, bottom mount doesn't attach all, every time hit bump car, phone mount flop around...poor design, need vent mount look elsewhere! 
 design okay, whole thing made really cheap plastic.the ball joint mechanism really hard move adjust.the ball joint plastic cylindrical protusion attaches holder. part broke, weak thin. gonna make important joint thin, should've made metal, cheap plastic. 
 guess crap shoot buy cheap, since lot reviews positive decided give try. unfortunately the&#34;spring loaded locking mechanism&#34; work one, making effectively useless 
 purchased case bbuy almost year. cheap, thin leather peeled way sharp jagged plastic case. recommend case also start loosen time. use dlo case it's reliable.i also high quality screen protector, imho, important protection put iphone. whatever case end getting, get high quality screen protector...as far case goes, i'm looking replace something lean still put phone dlo...as see, like layers protection beloved iphone! 
 used long 20+ hour flight (multiple connecting flights) recharged phone fine first flight. could recharge partially second (connecting) flight. recharged overnight hotel first destination going long bus ride, wouldn't fully charge phone enroute second destination. that's experience thing since then.the 5200 mah overrated. maybe like 3000 mah new, much less it's used couple times.this experience 2011. it's stored drawer year, found cleaning finally decided review it.junk, stay away. 
 mine looked good new seemed complete, seals package broken received it. pretty obviously something returned that's big deal (if underwear something might concerned). anyway, arrived nearly fully charged (four five lights) plugged usb port laptop. plugged output satechi nook color lo behold, nook proprietary cable lit started charging away. turned video let play satechi charged nook charge increasing consistently whole time.then disconnect satechi laptop longer powered. oops. less five seconds nook cable's charging light turned off. pressed status button satechi (which supposed briefly light indicators see much juice left) nothing...no lights all. nook started discharging normally.i plugged satechi back laptop status lights lit back up, well nook cable's charging light. bottom line: satechi obviously charged, wouldn't send charge nook unless satechi powered. kind defeats purpose. hadn't gotten appeared used goods would returned another - sounds like great thing - decided bothering returned it. 
 *** important: battery properly charges laptop usb port. attempt use car charger, wall charger, etc. unless confirm puts 500 ma, more. see [update] section below, details. ***[capacity summary: able (carefully!) charge droid x **which extended internal battery 20% capacity** 1.3 times. product worked advertised, able charge least 2.3 times, assuming li-ion phone battery poor end charging-efficiency spectrum. would expect least 2.7 charges droid x regular (non-extended) internal battery.]overall design nice; looks nice, shape good, attractive. but... several problems.first, battery supposed 'new' condition, clearly (and heavily) pre-used; box stains, sticky stuff, extra circular stickers (from previous 'owner' broke seal).second, didn't work. phone (droid x genuine motorola extended battery bh6x, holds 1800 mah instead usual 1500) could charge total 1.3 times, external battery totally drained. surprised, repeated test, got results. super careful: let external battery charge 36 hours; waited til phone 30%; charged 100% (cell on; gps/wireless off; tasks killed; screen off/no activity). disconnected external battery right away, phone reached 100%.i repeated process; plugged phone external battery 30%. two hours later, 70%, external battery 100% drained.very disappointing performance. able transfer 45% alleged energy droid x (1800 x 1.3 = 2340 mah, 5200), wikipedia says li ion able charge 80-90% efficiency -- something clearly wrong here.i would stay away; worried bought it, noticing many recent reviews (as april 2011) complained same. think they're selling bunch returned units. really irks me, i'm extremely busy, really don't time kind stuff; want buy product works lasts, i'm happy pay whatever takes.[update]satechi contacted me. claim smart phone chargers provide many amps, fries external battery. recommend *only* charging laptop (where usb limited 0.5a), whereas used (in two tests) chargers 850 1000 amps.however, excuse; design defect. able charge source, long least 500 ma. every electronics device planet circuitry limit amperage takes needs, gracefully rejects excess current. tried hard phone convince design defect; found disingenuous. review remains 1 star... sorry, satechi.[/end update] 
 connects quick phone, calls dropped. makes weird high pitch squeel charges. charger mini usb means use proprietary one (negative imo). got $-3 rebate. i'm happy getting paid $3 buy headset. good shipping.update: didn't get rebate $23 pretty bad bluetooth. one works currently. callers complain lots noise end. controls pretty bad cannot use voice commands htc incredible. 
 junk. never one sound bad. doesn't even hold charge long 
 ordered zagg screen guard,i figured really good becuase there'svideos people bragging it.well really dissapointed. why?because it's nothing piece rubber.it doesn't look normal phone. fingers didn'tglide accross screen. left much aresidue streaked.look, stick regular hard screen protectors.there way dependable less expensive comes 1. 
 instead giving guys long review product, going give summary product. btw, rookie term installing screen protectors, used work cell phone company, installed countless screen protectors customers.pro:nonecon:will distorte screen image, unclear (made cheap vinyl) super sticky, it's almost impossible remove without pulling screen phone literelly. leaves residues phone remove it, it's nightmare remove residues screen, even trick using piece tape remove residues. exchange phone removing screen protector touch sensore started acting me. asking refund, maybe even damage phone.if care expensive phone, please, please buy product, give nightmares handle! 
 ibought invisible shield back iphone 3g. studied installation videos instructions. invisible shield impossible apply properly. sticks peeling backing. edges apply properly around corners iphone 3g. part film apply back iphone looks nasty. least zagg accepted return credited charge money-back guarantee. 
 bought product seemed like excellent alternative case. product difficult install cover corners phone. ended throwing out, waste money difficult worth frustrated phone bubbles it. 
 acquired headset whensocom: confrontationwas first released thought getting deal getting game headset $60. couldn't wrong.as headsets go, worn lot them. i've owned old-fashioned wired headsets, pre-bluetooth wireless communicated little receiver clipped belt plugged phone, course... plenty bluetooth sets.let start saying need headset playstation3. theory, bluetooth headset work ps3. (granted won't bluetooth inherently buggy technology.) likewise, headset work almost bluetooth phone. however, personal preference separate headsets don't like pairing unpairing time.having said that, let's talk headset. basic basic gets. need basic, power you, you'll find similar quality less money sets. try thejabra bt4010, writing sells half price sony. heck, even find $10 bluetooth headsets really want go cheap!apart poor value, sony set awkward fit. thin rubber ring around little plastic "barrel" supposed stay fastened ear. sets either "form-fitted" rubber piece simply stay ear altogether. design gets uncomfortable quickly a) part goes ear may right size ear b) over-the-ear loop made cheap plastic opposed rubber rubber coating like many sets.the battery life decent, nothing write home about. charging stand? it's cheap, lightweight plastic falls easily. usb cable little bit stiff, natural tendency curl may well topple stand.as sound quality... yeah, basic again. sure, works, basic. felt like didn't good range volume. many times cranked max still could barely hear.since games usually $60 headset came bundled inside $60 game, tried hard find reason keep it, wasn't "free"? end, could find redeeming qualities returned rather allowing take space drawer somewhere.if you'd like good places start search another headset, few:personally, can't get thejabra freespeak bt250v. it's comfortable don't even notice it's also vibrating/call notification feature, absolutely great leaving phone charger keeping headset home office. writing, sony ~$45 jabra ~$60. may find jabra cheaper even $60 it's definitely better value sony!if you're looking really great sounding bluetooth set (i.e. listening music), i've really happy themotorola ht820. two speakers wraps around back head/neck. fair warning, though- motorola sounds awesome speakers huge wearing set makes look like total dork.there hundreds, maybe even thousands bluetooth headsets matter one finally choose, please don't make sony piece junk. dollars go farther something quality/lower price, price/higher quality. 
 unnecessary equipment ipod touch 2g, unless fingers gigantic. maybe might need this. gave mine away. 
 bought whole collection various styluses ipod touch. i've used handspring palm pdas 10 years (visor, m515, zire 71, tungsten tx) don't like using chubby fingers input touch. rubber-tipped styluses foam-tipped cousins don't job. iphone/touch screen surface designed work stylus. finding place keep stylus also problem. pda, slot it. ipod touch, slot, stylus pocket, touch. tried using styluses days, gave went back pudgy fingers. could write five times faster using graffiti, palm died alas, palm longer sells anything phones. 
 you're looking something make using touch screen easier use....save money. product work well all. push hard screen (which can't good screen) pain it's worth. 
 thing won't slide screen all. it's though actually designed grip screen like race car tire. absolutely worthless handwriting almost impossible use drawing. tap it.it's even worth $1. spend $10 real stylus actually slides screen minimal friction. 
 bought item iphone arrived suprise, work iphone. also made low quatity. great price worked. 
 got last night really excited first reading great reviews others. however, realized it's what's hyped be. memory didn't come phone go buy one separately last night map features doesn't even load prompts many questions crashes. furthermore, open battery case disconnect order phone work again! gps doesn't work either since old at&t; service don't data plan. thought gps feature like get buying gps separately doesn't require internet service satellite only. short-cut email feature doesn't work either! tried many ways get right keeps prompting messages again. log web site feature log yahoo get email way, what's short-cut feature doesn't work? also, difficult time find delete email account created one??!! number buttons really small want dial number really look right button push. features icons really small well many really understand one which. guess i'm used iphone's bigger icons user friendliness nokia big disappointment. wouldn't complaining much e71 hadn't $300 dollars. around $200 would give average rating instead one star. $300 much better. fact, iphone couple hundred worth it. didn't like battery life iphone gave e71 try. close, mention camera/flash seems work fine battery life e71 seems awesome long lasting fully charge it. may get cheaper version nokia since can't use email, map gps features phone. beware complaints order phone $300.edit:someone responded review saying since didn't data plan couldn't download maps emails. that's true logged wi-fi still didn't work, whereas iphone didn't issues. 
 bought nokia e71 straight talk service. thought best phone world, started givi g problems 1 1/2 weeks later. took back, got another one, within 3 weeks gave problems. could return itto phone company. boy return 6 times. getting new phone back time. last time 1 month ago, sent refurb phone, well 3 weeks ago. phone wont turn on, couldnt find memory card, gets hot, freezes time, reset it, lose main app" ovi store" send itback again. im upset nokia.this worse nokia phone ever had. ashame too, becausethis phone all. could work. looked nokia forum everybody complaining issues. everybody, model, similar models too. nokia please fix it. bacause right bottom. im really find another service provider due this. anybody know phone company unlimited everything low price makes good phones, let know. 
 bought phone amazon.com. at&t phone logo phone. truly unlocked phone. sim restriction removed. able make receive phone calls sim cards. able send receive txt, mms, email, use data, gps, internet, wifi becomes unusable. return item. buy featureless, sim unrestricted phone $15-$20 amazon.com online auction sites. disappointed. 
 used scroll lists, try type stylus', won't work. 
 don't waste money. first can't keep track it. second, dragges across screen end tool wide. keep clean?? lost again.... 
 luck this. order lost friendly customer service people sent replacement immediately upon notification...and added second free one...so complaints there. one fell apart couple days neither worked well. 
 doesn't work otterbox defender case! never tried without, 1 star know give. 
 impressed seller's delivery. item arrived month early. however product problems. ends splitter cable loose connected headphones stay well own. one ends splitter cable work. would ship back demand replacement, cost ship back hong kong way $1.10 paid it. overall, recommend anyone ordering seller again. 
 unfortunately one side splitter doesn't work. don't recommend it, since takes work ship back throw buy another one. 
 bought split audio computer two sources, seems simple enough noticed right channel working, unplugged splitter find tip plug (approx. first 1/8&#34;) broken inside computer audio port. ruin plug can't plug jacks computer audio outlet port broken piece stuck there. computer permanently crippled limited one channel due poorly made product. remember get pay for! 
 point case protect phone. case well. using couple weeks worked fine. didn't like could dock case nit picky.one day sitting curb waiting taxi take football game phone slid lap. fell total 6-12 inches max. landed bottom corner case split open. either side fell phone landed front glass cracking screen! much reading found screens pretty durable assume fluke must hit small pebble right. either way case would done job right fell phone would cracked.luckily phone works fine large crack annoyance weak spot any. thanks apple at&t; fix costs ~$200 happening. ended getting griffin easy dock case works great much sturdy design. 
 agree positive points reviewers said. could ideal case, 2 weeks clips hold two halfs together started breaking. kept together electricians tape broke off. bargain cell great immediately sent replacement 2 days already one cip broke. unfortunately without clips thing doesn't work. i'd gladly pay dollar clips work properly, i've ordered silicone case. 
 holster big iphone (3g) snug fit. found another holster smaller liked better. 
 warning: want save time, money, iphone, never consider crappy item.the holster one metal clip center two loop straps hold pants belt. imitation leather skin actually thin cloth sandwiching cardboard paper.in less 3 days purchase, one loop straps tore stitches case body.another 2 weeks passed found metal clip missing holster barely hanging remaining loop strap. lucky found iphone would fall onto concrete floor.nothing say. 
 crap. case small fit iphone vibrant. case sent looks nothing like ordered. small snap loops instead permanent ones like picture. cheap would cost return worth. 
 get pay for.... pay cheap cheap.... leather texture sort flimsy (not mention) thin covering peeled simply trying put belt. basic pouch, flap, magnet design. add insult injury magnet isnt even strong one. dont know many times phone fell case actions simple getting truck bump seat. 
 get thin case work case. belt loops broke 3 months use. got grantwood iphone holster instead. 
 case fit blackberry storm, although seller claims does.the case small storm silicone skin big naked storm (the phone bangs side side). 
 either poor decription, confusing pictures amazon, ordered case iphone 4. much short. looking various views, less 3 different items shown. hope get money back, mostly shipping. cannot comment quality case fit. 
 easy follow instructions may actually work phone would pair connect mac laptop bought for. disappointed amazon nowhere first 2 pages mention piece junk bluetooth technology item. 4 pages there;s mention reviews labelled motorola bluetooth speaker. also fine print box statement might buy bluetooth adapter pc assume mac also. waste time also expect hit return postage item designed purpose purchased 
 bought broke. don't even know wasted time, wasn't even long cord... purchase phone!b00dv2oqfythe product way better actually correct length & durability. 
 bought case wanted purchase sturdy reliable case iphones 3gs. case terrible. lets dust dirt scratch back phone time 2 parts allow case fit together always come apart. plastic case made also brittle. eventually begins chip away time thus leaving areas phone exposed. it's terrible case waste money! 
 bought cover phone att store. liked design cover virtually lip cover screen. however, really disappointed cover. here's main problems it:1. doesn't fit screen protecter well. one corner screen protecter keeps coming up.2. it's leaving marks phone. took cover day saw rubbed red coloring onto phone. luckily wiped don't like fact rubbing phone.3. biggest problem case. doesn't stay on!! case lock together constantly coming apart. find put phone pocket pull back end pulling case phone. good case constantly coming off!i like case would suggest anyone buy it! would suggest finding one either slips phone (like gel type covers) one truly snaps around phone. 
 bought 2 - 1 broke putting phone. stay together. look elsewhere case. 
 two things make recommend buying case:1. bump back apparently supposed hold two halves together: ends tilting phone backwards slightly whenever put down, makes much harder see screen. (it also doesn't hold two halves together).2. every time attach headphones, case slides reattach it. beyond annoying.another note: case listed separately color, bad review going show pink unless copy colors. difference various colors, one review would apply all. 
 green color really cute. bought replace pink one bought at&t store much money. however, green case broke exact places indicated users' photos. within couple weeks getting it. heck? thank goodness amazon amazing return policy. disappointed pink ifrogz case withstood lot abuse toddler. 
 one positive thing say despite expectations, thin piece plastic front bottom piece hasn't snapped...yet. got case freebie bought iphone. wife liked color it. course next two weeks nearly dropped phone several times bottom piece slid taking pocket. simply won't stay on. it's snug phone either. gaps top bottom plug headphones docking cable slides case. simply poor design. got free want money back. 
 made mistake purchasing one at&t store ridiculous price compared amazon. perhaps $10 worth having, cases already worn away color around edges screen playing games using phone. haven't much longer month wear started show quickly. instead looking like cool metallic case, looks like cheap plastic case painted cool metallic color. good quality. 
 2 days normal use, blue paint begins peel off! silver-metal material showing. looks ugly! would never buy again. 
 iphone 3gs outerbox protective case. armband case small fit outerbox case don't want take outerbox case every time want use armband. waste money. 
 idea purchasing product would fit arm anyone 400 pounds. band made fitted anyone smaller. 
 guess get pay for... plastic work well touch screen.. really sucks... tried cutting out... afraid iphone might come out.... so, i'm back holding running... 
 say? clips keep tight broke maybe one week use.it cheap product even worth value paid for...unfortunately, worth shipment price either.do waste money junk! 
 screen protector shield included case cover fit iphone 3g. align "home" button, screen protector shield long bottom covers chrome trim. align bottom screen, covers part "home" button.there also weird cutout upper left align cutout case cover.additionally, screen protector shield scratches easily.if you're purchasing case cover, factor cost purchasing separate screen protector cost included screen protector shield useless.also, purchase one merchants listed besides pc micro store. pc micro store's shipping slow. took week receive live city them. 
 earlobe turn red wearing 1 hour. pads protect earlobes. every time turn head, wire stick skin pull ear pieces. sound system cut out. push ear pieces together hands time want sound clearer. idiot design ? 
 worth money spent, worked well quality design durability. asked refund could 30 days. 
 told excellent product someone owns it, tried it. trying two bluetooth headsets this, wanted one people could finally hear without background noise. it. everyone trouble hearing it, saying static scratchy. think time bite bullet get jawbone. 
 product showed looked used. box properly, missing manual box ratty. seem new all. 
 large ear piece fit ear. uncomfortable. ear piece broken upon receipt. charger standard. recommend keep looking. 
 got september 2012, background noise always horrible, became really bad phone close bluetooth device. device right ear phone left pocket noise unbearable. three months use thing dies minute connected phone.guess get pay for. like chunky stays put ear like new light ones don't know ear not. 
 returned ,it looks like old huge star track headset ! dated large tacky draws attention thuggish looking . didnt realize soo gaudy looking huge reason gave 1 stars work would wear work public.... taken market , think own! huge shiney! lol!!!!!!!! 
 itiem terrible plenty back ground noise static. ordered 2 find hugh mistake. 
 never felt good wearing it. pain,pain,pain!! don't waste money thing. mine 1/3 price.it hard pair. well. 
 purchased 3 retail pack. packaging &#34;plantronics&#34; name, logo, part numbers. product may chinese counterfeit. 
 spent extra bucks buy plantronics. unfortunately, quit using headset callers complained call quality. 
 don't waste money. work, cost. pay $25 worth. unless plan watching video screen smaller 20 inches would buy this. 
 well first work like 1st try got bad didn't work bought nothing don't even buy it...: 
 ordered daughter phone. looking picture according description hard case rubber outer print. needed something sturdy teenager. useless plastic first time drops , break one like one received already broke first time bumped. would seller pay closer attention desription picture 
 look cool! getting easy! sits drawer collecting dust! 
 dash mount holder garmin, loved, thought would great iphone. however, otterbox defender case phone (which love!), guess case it's heavy. mount won't keep phone upright enough see it. also, honda crv, dash slightly curved, doesn't sit well it. might good people, didn't work me. 
 looks alright didn't fit grandpas iphone 3g. fell ever took pocket. 
 agree others posted. protector applies easily privacy works well without dimming screen much. unfortunately protector thick touchscreen longer works screen applied. 
 didn't expect quality bad. three got, one uneven circle shape home button.what's really bad you've put screen protector on, won't get clear screen protector. actually see soap film like bubble screen. waited days, soap film still visible. it's extremely irritating unattractive. would recommend item all! 
 palm treo breaks. replacement (refurbished unit) breaks, second replacement unit (refurbished) breaks. overall design good, manufacturing appears lacking. 
 battery arrived time visually identical original oem battery. however, quickly lost ability retain charge requires daily recharging original oem battery lasted 3-5 days new. it's better worn 2-1/2 year old original battery replaced. 
 charged, battery lasts 6 hours without mush usage. first thought great, nice fit, appeared charge fine. maybe got lemon, maybe it's generic brand. would buy one 
 don't know got bad set, 3 way cutting. line ear hole, causes button hole misaligned top whole thing large. caused bubbles around whole rim would fit inside rim slightly higher screen. horrible qc say least. 
 bought wal-mart, three screen protectors bigger iphone 3g screen. intentionally made way screen would peel wear fast.they produce lot glare compare screen savers i've used past.scratched easily, finger prints, etc... point screen protectors suck!the best ones i've used protectors bought fry's electronics made japan. unfortunately, fry's doesn't sell anymore. 
 jmho; they'll never look good phone's screen itself; everyone know try put wind stuff stuck screen protector, creating bubbles make phone's beautiful screen look like crap. watch wonder 'gift' drives nuts, trying re-install product again, winding frustration never get quite right. month, gave screen protectors iphone; year later, still scratches (but carry mine holster, pocket tossed purse, ymmv) screen still looks pristine; guess that's used glass plastic screen. 
 purchased bluetooth would charge. emailed company sent another one wouldnt charge either. purchased blue tooth another online company would work either, go motorolla. 
 though headset works fine audio comfortable wear, recommend hold charge long. previous headsets owned lasted least week one hour day use average. one requires charging every day. 
 ordered christmas gift brother law - arrived time, clear plastic bag. box. considering cost, surprised, may return it. without box makes think feel truck, don't know i'm supposed gift planned.update: difficulties shipper, offered send box did, gift box, go find another. irritating, real problem came brother law tried use it. never worked! even took apple store try get help, good. sent back requested refund, never got refund. complained amazon gave store credit, apologized, never heard back seller! 
 materials design product far inferior cliphanger, comes without light cliphanger stick adhesive pad clear orcliphanger-universal caddy handheld devices, colors may varyor led, available cliphanger site. don't fooled thinking identical. "deluxe" smartclip's light difficult use dim. adhesive faulty. dropped phone 3 times first day (and still smartclip hand). avoid. 
 upon first receiving case, realized bottom half would fit snug top. however, since slight gap big deal, proceeded use primary case. unfortunately, less month use, case broken cracked numerous places regular use (i not, obviously, throw phone drop several times ground). color fading chipped certain areas. case absolutely horrible. recommend anyone. even low price isn't worth it. 
 guess get pay for. thing worked initially, gradually started smell like small electrical fire. 6 months occasional use, thing burned entirely.for s&gs; took thing apart. it's horribly made, design flaw practically guaranteed cause electrical failure. failure won't burn car burn iphone, stop working. 
 bought three things year ago. gave one girlfriend, one brother, kept one myself.at first worked great. within less year, failed. none work now.in short, things must kind design flaw, resulting failure months. don't waste money. many similar products market similar price. 
 amazon shall remove product vendor list.the connector fit 3g 3gs iphone, pure trash.i requested money back, much waste timeand energy. shame amazon better quality controlover products list vendors business with.if want waste time money buy product.thanks

 product work promised...it fit iphone 3g, return back. amazon prompt returning refund.. 
 don't get wrong, good case, better couple others amazon half cost free shipping prime member. contacted otterbox customer service unresponsive abrupt. three cases (two iphones) would rate behind popular one amazon.the case offer good protection, screen protector makes difficult view phones apps bright light. also snap holster hold phone wearing jacket. clip style holster barely hold phone place jacket rubbing phone enough phone fall ground. need careful grass, snow loud area hear phone fall. 
 sennheiser used reputable; must agree say earbuds junk. shorter earbud worked intermittently first (plugging unplugging sometimes cleared problem) like asymmetric form much kept hoping would 'break in'. instead, broke, shorter earbud working all. bad, back kludge-but-robust sure adapter old sony earbuds. 
 bought two these, one worked never worked all. poor quality didn't expect much so. . . . 
 cord workit broke quickwaste money dont buy even worth spending money 
 bought three need them. fall apart. part goes touch falls apart four pieces apparently impossible get back together charges. one still together. super glue along seams last order good chargers. 
 used several bt head sets..motorolas, jabras, plantronics. weapon choice plantronic 510.large, hearing-aid ish looking gave great performance dog got ahold it.introduce jabra extreme.packaging- pleasing eyes.. impressive looking made excited open it.first glance - small.. im talking small enough concerned might loose (which pro con guess)headset - small size, equated small buttons (hard use bigger hands 6'2 225..i like feature dedicated slider -on/off switch. didnt sit wait hold button power on. tiny little volume buttons made hard find hard push ear..accessories - atachments offered. hard mean hard rubber ear piece... thats it. soft gel cushion option replacement earpiece.there tiny, paperclip thin hard plastic piece slips ear hold place felt like stabbing behind ear.the power accessories nice. impressed came usb adaptor plug could charge pc work, fit car charger came with. nice!!fit - uncomfortable best. weight nice often forgot wearing it, didnt fit ears. im dumbo means..performance - great. sounded muffled would call land line cell phone wasnt much better. verizon wireless washington d.c. metro area (30 min north) vzw full service over. headset. if, middle call id switch plantronics 510, problem would resolve itself.despite nice car charger/usb adaptor, nice look/color falls short due horrible fit/feel making ear hurt wearing it, horrible performance calls.

 well, it's consistent.the stock cable came blackberry micro-usb bb end. base needs mini-usb connection. didn't fit.but then, bbbold didn't fit either; wasn't secure, looked like charging nibs would dead short metallic band around rim case ... perhaps it's well didn't cable.anyway, it's going back immediately. 
 description incorrect product match device. 
 thought 9900. ordered wrong product. error, error company product... 
 storm comes screen protector already. unless want replace orginal bubble-free protector own, need buy this. 
 battery looks like photo says rim blackberry, hold charge. fully charged, even last eight hours. battery made china, ones seem work better made japan. battery replacing made japan years use,it actually still better new made china battery. it's worth amount money - don't buy it. 
 bad battery ded reached mei call get one morei recomand dont buy blackberry standard battery 9000 bold 
 spring clip broke 40 days use. can't even return since it's 10 days past 30 day amazon return policy. yes, seido ship replacement free. doesn't address design flaw - spring clip attachment brittle break weeks. i've using holsters like since 2000 - original palm treo, blackberry, iphone. first holster i've used design flawed. save $30 get another one. 
 got ct12 (unless ct10) back 2000. loved it: saved neck pain associated tilting neck hold phone shoulder ear. sound quality great. phone worked whether docked charger roaming house. sound quality exceptional. problem ever dropped time finally, years abuse, killed it. (in fact, two phones 2000 2010, finally decided couldn't squeeze anymore life second one, also victim falls.) compared older models, ct14 terrible disappointment. i'm using location, yet constant irritating sound background. cannot used docked charger. may sound like big issue. answer phones, one get headset on, press talk button call goes voicemail. old model, steps. ct14, 3rd step -- pull phone charger, get headset on, press talk. it's easy quickly, especially headset plug pull phone quite easily. also, you're using phone inadvertently put back charger you're using sitting desk charger is, phone disconnects call. danger phone blowing giving cancer use charger, i'd interested know. otherwise, seems like design flaw. rating phone particularly low loved older model much. revalation. one terrible comparison. (if never older version, one might frustrate much me. really, okay terrible sound quality.) 
 low-grade static buzz sound one hear almost always. audible others significantly diminshes usability product. item also corded, another significant hamstring. 1 star - unusable, unsatisfactory quality, poor technology. 
 use home office it's done job far. little staticky places haven't isolated phone, vonage, conference service use.setup straight forward setting time date easy. haven't used many options phone except mute conference easy enough. headset flimsy cheap feeling especially used plantronics quality, it's job sound quality good.overall nice travel phone stays way.update - june 23rd - one year later, it's breaking.close one year later. reduced one star daily typical office use headphone starting crackle drop audio. seems connection carry base unit somehow dropping connection makes essentially useless. carries one year warranty past point help. rare actually take headphone base could caused connection issues, i'm certain lost it's audio. 
 got phone thinking would lot better was. annoyingly slow. lots bugs drives crazy. nearly every day want beat hammer. would rather one old brick phones piece junk. don't waste money!!! 
 anxiously awaited phone couple months, day finally came phone arrived disappointment was!i spent week trying "get used" feel phone, really gave every effort phone didn't work way have. know software releases make phone work way intended didn't time invest it.i'll make short point, you're business/power email user phone cramp style, try week two see. numerous times buttons screen accidentally touched camera would come different things would activate.the screen rotation system horrible 3-5 second delay landscape portrait mode mention phone awfully slow.and keep mind, wasn't phone, ordered 5 everyone complained thing, sent back. even now, weeks release people still seem disappointed "stuck" them.this would make great phone teenager still school, use blackberry make deals happen manage day phone sad disappointment!! 
 going keep short since i'm go verizon store replace "storm" (aptly named) curve. phone disaster. buggy, bugs fixed upgrades, never fix really (for me, least) difficult use touchscreen keyboard. problem nearly impossible touch nearby key keyboard slows one considerably. i've tried, really wanted phone great given features, can't stand it. also, want use keyboard, go menu, scroll (should top menu choice) select "show keyboard." that's annoyance used keyboard (a real one) right device. entering information field webpage, keyboard automatically come up. tap exactly field data entry box page (good luck that; magnify page demagnify page view entering text). user unfriendly enormous missed opportunity rim create something great. 
 easy google benchmarks details, tilt, another htc/qualcomm device well-documented, inferior multimedia capabilities compared (samsung, lg, toshiba, apple, nokia) devices. current qualcomm cpus well-documented slower even circa 2002-2003 pocketpc devices comes multimedia. it's unfortunate class-action law suite hasn't panned out.even poorly received clie nx/ux keyboards, sony hasn't improved design.it also doesn't help device delivered cracks casing whole first-batch us launch recalled. nov 28, 2008 launch "back-ordered" january, 2009. 
 don't know sure due cable software, never got work. gave got tablet (see review motorola xoom) realized bluetooth works great transfer phone's photos. price cheap wasn't worth returning. 
 bought transfer photos samsung phone. didn't work anything charger. save money go elsewhere! 
 waste time buying protect anything called shutterbox phone may brek pieces drop thing rubber it. 
 ok, many people know difference? now. get defender case hard plastic rubber. rubber case waste money, better nothing. priced same, get better one.this going back. 
 case absolutely perfect first received it. offers great protection, lightweight, doesn't slide countertop etc, comfortable hold. however, 3 months continuous use noticed placed phone call took iphone away ear use keypad, speaker, access app, end phone call screen would stay black wouldn't allow anything. went apple store thinking something wrong phone however case issue. little sensors near speaker front phone little triangle cutout case. case stretched covered sensors case removed works perfectly. 
 believe otterbox puts name product. waste money!!! junk. 
 many recent reviews noted, thing stretched month longer aligns properly earpiece, sensors, buttons. sticky rubberized cases used/seen but, still gets stuck pocket covered fair amount lint. stopped using mine went back marware sport grip case get really linty holds phone nice snug. otter "don't buy". 
 trusted otterbox cases years relied them. case fit iphone 3 phone. tried return it, vendor admit poor fit. may fluke, experience. 
 type iphone 4 case comes up? reason it! amazons fault. anybody else feel way? 
 cover sags bit sometime fit perfectly anyways. would recommend all.

 battery never made single day's use wife's phone despite &#34;breaking in&#34; several charges. would recommernd battery anyone although know price cheap compared oem batteries sold at&t. definitely don't know sure, guess, i'd say rejects recycled. 
 don't buy this, one ever hear me, repeat everything always give disconnect. 
 returned jawbone one frustrating day.all control buttons hidden view touch. attempts adjust volume cancelled calls.not recomended. 
 krusell amazon playing games product coverage. 1.5 mos purchasing, one belt loops came completely detached. amazon won't return exchange since it's month old. krusell claims lifetime warranty, completing online registration process warranty, require activation - never send! buy risk - product protected! 
 bought 3gs fit right. came adhesive ( double stick tape type ) fit top bottom, sides. placed glass, stuck fine top bottom bowed little center. problem placement. perfectly aligned. way bowed, touch screen would work properly. 
 far ordered 3 different replacement screens iphone none stay attatched mother board. digitizer ribbon snap wrong size (too big) stay attatched. checked different original apple iphone screen, make sure wasnt main board not. screen snapped fine. ribbons screens wrong 
 iphone fit case - disappointed. looking forward using case phone. 
 don't let picture wording fool you. good product. type fake leather wrapped around thin cardboard. 
 get get price. &#34;magnet&#34; close lasted day. dont waste penny 
 genuine leather ..? back piece leather, it's synthetic bad quality material. so, belt clip weeks later completely damaged ..it seems poor quality starts factory one side panels also came unstitched.a star, allow half placed .. 
 pouch looked better picture. putting protective cover iphone, scarely put iphone pouch. pouch tight kept hitting call button. use now. pouch meant iphone. seriously, know put protective cover iphone. made pouch little width. lot choices. 
 one magnetic closure, snap, wish known that, flimsy standards 
 spring unit pushes two way 12v socket. contacted seller got repsonse.update, partially melted last time used it. fire hazard? possibly. 
 closet maybe sold yard sale one day. bad purchase decision part, great concept doesn't work older vehicles 
 really excited this! wanted able charge phone use radar detector simultaneously, worked great almost month sudden stopped. nothing broken place see never moved definitely work anymore. get refund sellers polite fact remains same... work forever 
 researching ways boost cell signals found this. reading many reviews realized issue weak cell signals fixed, easily permanently, cell phone use wifi make receive calls text data. weak cell signal common problem concrete metal buildings shielding signals out. always access wifi home office. republic wireless solved problem two years ago. uses voip calling backed sprint cell verizon roaming. also works world wide wifi $5 month. service unlimited contract. unlimited call text plan $10 month, unlimited cell, text data $25 month. use phone (moto x $299 moto g $149) need republic's proprietary software work rates. using 18 months worked perfectly. 
 tries several different spots home could get good signal replicate. try another brand see works. 
 made sure compatible phone bought is. work all. excited arrived. followed instructions carefully still work, fact seemed mess wifi signal little. favor dont buy garbage. good thing get refund. 
 went great lengths make sure bought 33 dollar one direct amazom. came blackberry packaging authentic looking markings. 2 weeks it's already failing hold charge throughout day. don't know it's related unit seems reboot spontaneiously every day so- i'm talking full 10 minute reboot too, soft restart. really unhappy amazon one. bought cheaper one month ago bad right box. hard get real battery replace oem one? 
 white iphone ordered white color elago case go it. picture looks nice reality, it's cheaply manufactured plastic junk. it's plastic covered white paint plastic edge rough scratch iphone. spend money get better casing. 
 pictures would believe near mil-spec case, protecting phone shock, moisture dirt. even close. specifics...once assembled around phone, unit easily falls included belt clip. two little ears belt clip securely hold phone case place. best, case store pocket purse, although case makes phone quite bulky. phone case, charge cord cannot connected, least can't get multiple chargers work (we 11 phones). outer rubber housing, meant absorb shock thin...far thinner standard otter box soft phone cases inner yellow shell made hard, unyielding plastic, doubt case offers much real protection iphone dropped height. one, poorly conceived design meant, suspect look tough much else. otterbox defender series 3 case fails every way given poorly performs, grossly overpriced boot. 
 got money taken reply thats can't even contact them, sent otter back never got money don't waste time buying 
 otterbox rated.griffin way go.period!never buy otterbox. protective many others. sold walmart people know. 
 tilt, provide windows mobile applications video drivers spare time.easy google benchmarks details, tilt, another htc/qualcomm device well-documented, inferior (4 times slower) multimedia capabilities compared (samsung, lg, toshiba, apple, nokia) devices. fuze actually benchmarks slightly slower circa 2002-2003 200mhz pocketpc devices comes multimedia. it's unfortunate htc class-action law suite hasn't panned out.this superior keyboard compared xperia x1, greasy, finger-print attracting thin casing makes phone feel like toy. "diamond" points back case also wear less week due poor plastic quality.vga amazing device albeit wasted less 2.8" size instead useful eye-forgiving 3". actually also take photos versus blurring/stuttering tilt camera, pictures look spectacular. accelerometer-enabled album viewing takes much pain portrait vs landscape. bad album still isn't syncable picasa easy off-loading.however, new usb drive mode (directly accesses microsd/hc locks access windows mobile), makes easy transfer files, use directory-based album browser photos.the auto-backlight tends bright doesn't get dark enough dark settings. luckily there's apps levelsight deal this.hsdpa locked work around at&t;'s registry locks 3g speeds quite slow. either towers overloaded iphones, back haul towers 1mbps max.the push-to-talk useless isn't obvious way reassign button use. luckily, there's hacks google reassign two different things bring comm manager, camera app.another major issue gps really slow initial lock. take two minutes locks compared tilt. turning a-gps (without signing onto at&t; navigator) doesn't improve speed actually cause 3rd party gpss loose gps lock repeatedly (in 1 minute time span beyond) including garmin mobile xt igo8 finally getting gps lock. luckily again, there's app called fusiongpsfix attempts deal this.it's bad one company design design mostly show reliable usability.for instance destroyed d-pad. it's almost impossible hit left right 4-way direction pad pad, control surface shared 4 buttons. you're likely hit dial home sloppy press left. you're likely hit back hangup sloppy press right. limitations hit especially hard want navigate calendar program play game.combined bad d-pad design sharing surface ipod capacitive scroll capability. superficially, would nice one thumb able scroll ipod-like lists hit center button select. reality drawing circle around center button results responsive behavior, moving thumb center selection cause accidentally scrolling.it's also inane put volume ptt button side slider face makes slide! push buttons, whole face twist wiggle. really shows keyboard-slide sloppy add-on original diamond design. 
 samsung's use proprietary jack charging phone connecting headset miserable design decision, consumer's perspective. i'm sure adds bottom line. i've tried three adapters two different suppliers none work known-to-be-functional headset. giving going back bluetooth earpiece. 
 ordered 2 items shipped something totally different, shipped right item neither worked. one broken, one didnt pass sound wouldnt buy again. although kind enough give refund thats good. 
 havent gotten yet. ordered november 18th, december 9th. emailed said country gove 2 weeks. already emailed friday. so, guess kids get sometime next year. 
 piece cheap junk. well guess get pay cases. bought daughter tip broke phone day gave her.the noise hush real good.big c. 
 one end longer mic bad hate broke 2 months 
 3rd 4th pair headphones always stop working awhile. :/ always one side headphone. 
 ok one ear phone longer break u get u pay for. 
 bought second charger blackberry tour. appears charge phone, phone basically non-functional charger connected. charger removed, phone starts working, again. 
 worked couple months stopped charging phone. upset. set fire. 
 bought two spare chargers. wasted money never charged actually think ruined one phones. thank god protection plan got phone replaced. price didn't even bother returning them. may work work gs3. 
 bought gift dead arrival. maybe bad one trouble takes return something bought online much trashed it. 
 recommend it.it last long, cheaply made. please dont wast money it. pay little bit get better one. piece junk known would purchased!karlac 
 gave girlfriend use blackberry phone, said got hot stopped working. maybe charged phone twice ??? 
 like another item bought orange discount center, wasn't oem, even though said was. fault. know better. 
 least 4 sets these. run great run except one commenter's said constantly cut out. finally placed lg shoulder 10 inches away stayed contact.every one quit working 20miles. company said might due sweat getting in. sounded great hoping company would fix problem. far haven't. couch potato wants wireless head set answers phone, great. 5 stars. active sweat little, don't purchase. donnie 
 given set can't life figure people like much. sound quality great bass all, thats kind expected size. call quality superb hands free works flawlessly too. comfortable around head too. battery life also great. hate much? signal! terrible! don't expect work pair. move audio cuts out. stick phone pocket cuts point usually get frustrated shut use loud speaker. ashame really, signal issues i'd give pair 5 stars. major deal breaker! 
 sound quality awesome, limitation using outside plain dumb. two sets these- thinking first one defective. smaller enclosed spaces like offices, living room, airplane seat, etc., work great. try use large fitness center outdoors like jogging, cycling, etc., audio cuts 3-4 times minute. apparently, bluetooth receiver thing isn't sensitive depends walls bounce signal player headset. walls = poor performance. first thought first set defective. getting warranty replacement experiencing problems, read instructions. (i know, know). explain put music player back pocket, preferably high/close headset can. dumb that? find music player placed line-of-sight within 6-8 inches headset, works uninterrupted. great deal trouble jogging holding mp3 player behind head.one thing really bugs me. motorola outsourced customer service jobs outside united states. care this, (as do), might want know. 
 several copies previous version great died typically around 6 months purchase. don't know whether model still sold heavy ears. 
 never use - always cutting out, even normal telephone headset. tried multiple types phones, doesn't cut it. 
 idea motorola claim ever 'flagship' stereo bluetooth headphones. problem syncing it, installing it, figuring use buttons (though bit small annoying). however, never use it, drops syncing provocation. compared much cheaper motorola stereo bluetooth headphones (s305), simply work. sync 3 minutes drop connection. re-sync, stand exact spot listening exact music exact phone s305, s305 works fine piece carp skips drops signal. using motorola phone! (z6m)do buy s9 s10 s-anything motorola, unless like curse. questions, could s9-hd upgrade s9? s9 must used coat hook only. 
 tried s9 reviews. mistake!!! fit, wrapping around back neck pulling ears, drives crazy. used s9 imac computer. terrible time pairing.but tight grabbing neck fit totally un acceptable.exchanged jabra halo bt650s set loved jabra halo 100%. 
 got motorola s9-hd week want deal wired headphones running. product received came original box authenticity hologram attached arm.the short works, job great sound quality good. contrary reviewers, pretty comfortable fit. pairing also easy. like button placement etc. paired laptop ipod nano wireless transmitter (i10s (luxurious white) tiny bluetooth ipod transmitter ipod/iphone/ipad/itouch).i couple bluetooth headphones suitable active sports. one better job staying head, big annoying problem signal cut-offs. s9-hd frequently loose signal transmitter. cannot keep ipod reliably pocket. hold hand. thought issue wireless transmitter headphones laptop sitting directly front laptop also bluetooth headphones cut-off frequently, short distance.edit: cut-offs seems less ipod s9-hd fully charged. battery starts drain time (say hour so) cut-offs become often. either battery small fully charging fully (or both). perhaps, charge/discharge cycles situation may improve. i'll update review see improvement.edit2: cut-offs continuing month use. annoyance probably flaw device bluetooth devices problem. unfortunately, besides motorola s9 s10, bluetooth headphones suitable active sports. 
 soon plugged item in...nothing happened. work connect solid enough get car's 250 psi air compressor work. (i tried pump tire wheel barrow.) yes, compressor works fine plugged car's lighter. 
 got could plug slime comp02 12-volt tire inflator wall socket eventhough little diode lights doesn't power inflator !?not recommended. 
 i'm sure going high ratings, sent flimsy plastic case painted, poorly, black outside white inside - plastic well. quickly scratch phone nothing prevent plastic-on-plastic scratching. course, get ~$8.00 (cost plus shipping) suppose, need think twice purchase want $200 $500 phone (depending contract not) scratched days.by way, single thing rubber this. absolute false advertisement. might sent wrong item, invoice package indicate that. 
 bought one convenient way charge sync ipaq glisten. charge, simply won't connect computer via usb. tried another phone another computer. still joy. similar products market work. buy one those, piece garbage. 
 cable connection good damage devices.seems charge ok, get good cable, keep inserting-removing usb port... phone even flash charging state fast enough, that's happens cable. data keep get reconnects time point it's impossible transfer one large file. proves connectivity continuity cable connectors sucks big time. tested 2 cables.no phone shows micro disconnects charging, may even it's flashing off.will even bother returning. probably use spring mechanism cables around, one wouldn't use connect expensive phones. all. 
 ownership 3 days.today went plug phone pc pow!spring there, 3 pieces plastic broken there.yes wire still works retractable anymore!this garbage! 
 moment got product broken. pull cord extend it, it's supposed stay extended always snaps back retracted position. means keep phone one inch away pc use it. wasn't worth cost shipping get replaced. suggest purchase slightly expensive model "push button" lock keep cable extended. 
 bought item it's competitor &#34;micro usb retractable cable - ideal micro usb...&#34;. another one looks durable. one already broke another one still works. 
 honestly say product quality lasted week one ear jacks already broke mention really don't stay well ears first place 
 owned 2 bb brand headsets failed (one side stops working). replaced withaltec lansing uhp326 backbeat series ear headphone ultimate ears technology. it's expensive $30 worth it! 
 headset sucked price annoyed pay much get cruddy result. lost lots calls one could me...awful. 
 worked great 2 weeks, disconnects 5 minutes call. don't know why. reset it, reset phone, re-paired headset, could, it's useless now. returning it.also, head band bit tight -- gave headache, willing live clarity. oh well. 
 made used everyday phone gets lots use. work wire gets bent split. 
 cannot get audio 3.5 connection. tried several standard headphones. so, plugged in, phone starts auto-dialing last dialed numbered.i spent quite lot time trying understand make work. searching reading web taught slam dunk. 2.5 3.5 connectors wired number different ways support mono, stereo, mic, etc. plugs 1, 2 3 rings (respectively 2, 3 4 connectors - connector metal part rings).however htc part meant work htc mogul sprint phone - doesn't. conclusion far adapter came short defect 'short' wiring though empirical tests conclusive. example, get mono audio plugging telephone headset 2.5 connection. weird thing plug stereo standard 3.5 headphone connection (using another 2.5 3.5 adapter) get audio.after many frustrating hours came one workaround works - plug earphone proprietary port check sound, plug another one 2.5 test plug -slowly- 3.5 - gets audio unplug two.i returned mine ordered another vendor. hope part defective; shudder think supposed work problem phone itself. 
 fairly excited hear product. find iphone screen simple use, thought could get extra finesse thing.well, finess one thing have. light - sort conductive foam tip. foam tip seems quite flimsy confidence remain attached long. whole thing put together perhaps 20 cents worth stuff - gall charge $15 it.so - function:it take great deal effort effect screen finger alone. screen really read well - push far harder comfortable doing.the screen recognize - eventually - really - it's flimsy tip problem mind.overall - worth effort $$ - fingers free work far better iphone ipod touch. get nice screen protector far happier. 
 bought thing replace samsung sounded great little clunky. immediately dissapointed charger clearly designed item kind-of-half-way attaches one earphone. it's micro-usb type, something must plugged wall--not 2 usb car charger, next phone. actual headset remarkably sleek, kept open mind eight-hour initial charging session. dissapointed flat, tinny sound finally came stylish lightweight headset finally played new coldplay album android phone. audiophile sound earbuds really, really noticeably poor compared samsung replaced. like heavy deep base really let-down. summary, looks cool, it's functional, i'll wear gym, sounds substandard.update:downgraded one star. listening earphones hour, decided sound quality unacceptably poor. fortunately, amazon fantastic way handling returns able print return authorization shipping label--postage included--for full refund. first return experience amazon make less hesitant purchase items online likely choose amazon sellers. 
 headset died 2 months, warranty expired.i took look online forums seems may bought &#34;knock off&#34;. i'm expert supposedly original devices, would've expected original purchased amazon.anyway, favor buy lg headset. it's durable, battery indicator, doesn't die light use. 
 sony seem care customer needs. behaving stubbornly another proprietary charger instead simply using universal usb serious companies use. want force us carry another charger?when sony going care customer needs instead thinking extract pennies us? 
 means audiophile - people say good sound crazy - excited iphone got 3.0 update thought sure stereo bluetooth finally evolved (based reviews) --my first experience motorola s9 - sounded crappy too. look awesome box - sound quality terrible - songs purchased itunes makes differnece -- sound made basically unusable -- found previous bt stereo headsets - oh well -i guess 'll keep waiting. 
 total waste time. folks, learn hard lesson i've learned, order items frm prime certified sellers. ohterwise, dont know youre getting, spending money like going vegas. gamble. 
 battery came quickly good condition. it's cell seems working fine. true test next week i'm work. far good looks like would purchase future. update next week. 
 purchase battery spare blackberry phone. placed battery phone didn't even recognize it. plugged charger light continued red two hours. sinced moved lost great still phone original battery works fine. don't buy it's waste good money. 
 refurbished, believe. terrible batteries. going buy these, would recommend buying least 3... bought 1. didn't work. soon got package, swapped batteries old one blackberry. charged 3 hours checking battery level. stuck 90%... unplugged phone wall charger,the battery died within 30 minutes. doesn't hold charge. wow. $7 good true good battery. ($7.00 shipping.) 
 apparently listing error amazon. happen persist time.the cable measures 33 inches long, that's even 1 meter, much less 1.5 meter.i quarrel amazon marketplace vendor bought amazon. mistakes happen.however, need 1.5m (65 inch) cable do, won't do.yes, cable work, described, ordered thought getting. thus, 1 star: product described product get.jerry 
 read 1.0m 1.5m. got cable clearly showed (on bag holding cable)that 1.0m. contacted vendor ask told check blackberry switched cable vendor. wouldn't touch product work vendor. 
 it's pity. worked fine got 1.5 "cupcake" update g1 phone. recognized phone, it's useless. 
 charge car charger work cd player 3.5mm aux outlet time. buy male/male audio chord plug htc headphone jack wire comes phone. looking using 3.5mm jack adapter, going useless. phone won't recognize market headphones plugged it, unless buy "sound route switcher" app market.overall, works great roadtrips but, good taking walk jogging. adapter add weight phone. 
 phone connected internet via wifi yet gave many freezing problems internet. ended nokia 5530 freezing problems happy phone. cannot recommend nokia 5800 freezing problems. think 5800 pretty phone big screen freezing problems...oh well, life goes on! glad nokia 5530! 
 fir phone forgot send back. screen battery resembles one phone received completely different battery. shoulda sent back forgot 
 got phone little sister.... broke first week overall couldn't lot... fav.

 must say price awesome.. might gotten bad ones.. wouldnt stay on.. :( 
 broke days using never going buy waste money good luck everyone else 
 junk. terribly disappointed lack quality sweatshop made covers have. feel like cardboard painted clear polymer. huge rip off. 
 bought "leather" iphone 5 case received iphone 5. phone arrived case, took long time coming. know better order anything amazon prime, case looked good "description". nowhere box say case leather. took out, sticky look feel plastic coated fabric. even fabric grain. also know better order seller, dismal experiences ordering cases devices. arrive don't fit right, return pay almost cost purchase. worth way around. case protect iphone 5 anything, let alone fall; feel downright off-putting. seems like hastily made case try cash iphone 5 rush--but couldn't even get time plenty pre-order time. order case expecting leather; world would sell supposed retail $49.95 immediately reduced $9.95 ever came out. opportunistic way cash 5 needs without providing quality usable product, severely misrepresenting this. buy, unless willing write don't like it, return cost--even defective misrepresented product. 
 uncomfortable, people could hear well all; would stay ears. sent back. 
 i've 2. used one set broke 4 days. believe damage sweat. power button quit working. sent one back regretted getting refund first place. owned multiple bluetooth headphones know normal range is. poor range. disconnect line site. especially outside. work these! sweat break them, range play music pocket outside. 
 bought 906 version identical 903, adds bluetooth transmitter dongle non-bluetooth devices.this 4th plantronics bluetooth device 2nd stereo bt. taking back day use reasons:1) uncomfortable. hate ear phones love earbuds(or canal phones in-ear-monitors). seem somewhere in-between. 30 minutes ears hurt. granted, i've using sony earbuds last 8 years, that's comparing to. wear buds 8+ hours discomfort, i've wearing backbeats 3.5 hours today they've uncomfortable throughout. get one size i'd say average small ear canals.2) sound alright. i'm coming 8 years $60 earbuds sony. lot treble sound tinny me. much better experience older plantronics 855 stereo bluetooth used earbuds similar sonys. like defined bass gives rock alternative music punch. backbeats make music familiar sound much less dynamic. use bass boost option music. think people fine sound, discerning listeners look elsewhere. feature called openmic supposed allow hear outside world better press button. problems hearing around option turned off, one 2 settings adds low static hum.3) made one phone call 30 minutes driving car windows 5 minutes friend told take back difficult understand voice sounded "hollow". functional, transparent. end, problems understanding friend complaints receiving.on positive note, buttons backbeat worked expected htc incredible. able pause, back track forward track songs, adjust volume. pairing easy. use meridian music player incredible backbeat controls well. go meridian player's preferences turn headset controls allow control pandora, last fm slacker. slacker sounded terrible - seemed dramatic lack bass i've read known problem slacker using wi-fi.battery life seems great. i've listening music made 40 minutes phone calls last 4 hours backbeat battery indicator shows still 1/3 2/3's full. i'm willing use longer due ear discomfort.the ear design wasn't bad thick arnette sunglasses on. add baseball cap top you've got problem. cord behind neck solid, others noted, want lay back head pillow headrest, significantly apply pressure ears really highlights uncomfortable backbeat wear.the separate dongle get 906 model worked expected. go pairing process time switched incredible dongle. i'm sure better way, didn't seem automatic initial pairings.bottom line, don't bother trying unless take back full refund. look good on, don't fit right, think going disappointed. i've also read may huge reliability issues backbeat seem hold sweat probably avoid costs. 
 i've little less year. bought last may stopped working! still probably buy another set $40 cheaper buy $15 wired earbuds last month. want manufacturer admit sweat proof make pair really water proof done! 
 device pull shelf toss trash.they need refund customers. tuck ears. hold hands listen nobody want it. idiot approved project step find another bright person 
 bought use iphone 4. worked great 24hrs. controls worked life great. call quality sound good. second day, pause button stopped working couldn't change tracks anymore. resetting reconnecting didn't good. sent back looking options.believe me, wanted like product...and worked. maybe you'll better luck, price luck shouldn't anything it. sorry plantronics. 
 product seems decent. quality good etc. however advertised fitting galaxy nexus, not. galaxy nexus want phone fit completely case don't buy this. won't. sticks top, screen part sticks used disply doens't look good. dissapointed price paid this. recommned larger phones all. 
 received broken, didn't offer replace it. get pay for. buy!!!! 
 purchased charger samsung google nexus phone, quite disappointed. believe might technically able charge phone use, meet needs. unable charge phone use navigation. best, keeping phone charge. believe 700mah charger, 2000mah charger much better job. ymmv, i'd suggest looking elsewhere. 
 made china.the quality samsung unit questionable.the two halves case line correctly, excess molding around front insert 12v cig lighter. sticker crooked.i think thing fake. works fine girlfriends samsung galaxy, doesnt work lg. came small zip-loc style bag information.i'd avoid get different unit. owned samsung products past never released anything poorly built this. 
 don't work, simple that. tried 3 cars house case. i'll buy another another source. shipped time normal-good package. 
 read reviews ordered item. don't buying samsung s3. snail pace charging. wasted money. 
 receive charger 10 day stop work hourpiece junk pleas buy don't spent money charger 
 samsung chargers like one before, honestly don't last long all. don't understand crap easily, advised taking chance. 
 worked fine 3 months stopped charging, swapped couple cars effect. checked fuse wasn't blown; stopped working. 
 looks like it's built well engraved &#34;samsung&#34;, nothing trouble charger. fits loose socket wire wiggled held position constant charge. def loose connections. vendor sent replacement wound thing. recommend product. 
 highly disappointed product. mention received product fits little loose actual car charger. charges phone now. really thought wouldn't buy another charger while, looks like wrong! bought usb car charger (i hook usb cord phone charger) 3$ walmart product lasts longer durable. find quite sad would never buy product again. it's like threw money window go find another product. 
 bought charger didn't work. obviously wouldn't buy again, frustrating plug phone never charge. 
 originally wrote review stated charger actually worked. did. unfortunately, couple months died. don't know happened, throw out. don't waste month this. it'll end place mine did... trash. 
 item cheaply made fell apart multiple places within months. microusb port got twisted bent would connect. dc plug section came unglued/attached wire got loose. whole unit basically opened could closed way would stay closed. throw whole piece junk trash. recommend product price. 
 within weeks phone certain angle charge. then, wires inside wore out. don't buy it. 
 confirmed suspicion purchasing real oem samsung charger comparing product side side. cheaply made chinese knock-offs. stay away these. don't work!!!!

 cheap. didnt really work uncomfortable. beware product. although inexpensive worth money. trust me. 
 everyone couldn't understand headset iphone 4s...they said voice garbled would cut out. :(i ended buying plantronics one instead (see link below) works much better! complaints one whatsoever. initially went samsung trusted name brand. don't make mistake did!plantronics m50 - bluetooth headset - retail packaging - black 
 motorola bluetooth died many years use. coincidentially samsung wep 460 sale seemed bargain buyer beware, get pay for.with motorola bluetooth open thing attach ear unit turns on. remove close ear thing shuts off. samsung wep460 pushed turn pain neck get used extra step. forget shut taking power stays battery get drained.worse fact charger comes standard ac adaptor recharging inside home. way packaging is, charger hidden inside plastic bubble container hidden behind black paper. look closely back packaging image 1 millimeter shown -- look closely fine line drawing know charger inside ac indoor use.we routine using bluetooth driving car charging car leaving bluetooth charger car time. don't presently cigarette lighter car recharger fits samsung wep460 would another purchase us (therefore raising price cost owning unit vs motorola bluetooth). today see compatible cigarette lighter car charger sells msrp $45 expensive samsung wep460 bluetooth unit seems crazy!the sound quality fine.we regret purchase. next time we'll buy motorola bluetooth.we also learned lesson cost accessories accessory charger units. replacing existing accessories save money purchasing accessories compatible charging units already own. 
 uncomfortable. none different ear buds fit ear could barely hear sound highest volume. 
 can't believe samsung puts name piece junk. mean, would sell product , designed fit ear, held place flimsy piece plastic? warning things come fact 2 ear clips came unit. and, 2 clips break, piece unusable.so, get pay for!junk. 
 got found fit like brick ear, changed phones would sync new phone. still it, using target practice. 
 like keep reviews short simple. don't buy item bbry 8900. look elsewhere quality product. 
 looked cheap work ipod touch. broke trying unplug it. got response supplier. 
 fell apart two weeks good quality item would recommend anyone looking purchase cord. 
 bought replacement husband's iphone. previously noel collection case came mirror screen protector. product compared old screen protected extremely poor quality. mirror faded active mode makes screen green/blue color.i know cheap recommend going better quality ones. went buy better one pay shipping again, don't make mistake. 
 screen protector thick therefore, easy apply. however, mirrored surface makes display phone dark best invisible bright light. makes glare cannot see through. plan return even though it's much money. 
 screen protector performs shown. tell barely see screen applied. increased brightness 100% still hard time seeing screen. 
 buy product, worth money! mirror effect blurry can't see anything. service great product worth it! 
 expected mirror screen protector like one iphone right now. instead, it's cheap funhouse mirror type mirror...who wants look that?? 
 work well. cannot see mirror portion difficult apply. would try product similar future. 
 didnt fit iphone cheaply made came fast iwas suprise fast got didnt fit 
 nearly impossible put without getting bubbles dust.... went 5 gave completely. 
 product slighhhhhtly bigger iphone screen, big enough leave bubbles edge matter aligned. spent time try fit gave second sheet decide throw away whole package.don't bother buy it. 
 don't waste time product. backing peel off, can't use them. screen protector appears thin, couldn't tell sure b/c couldn't actually get protector order apply phone. little tab side help peel it, simply wouldn't separate backing screen protector--i returned defective even though it's much money--it's principle thing. cheap, shoddy stuff. 
 another gentleman gave product one star said me. product tab help put protector phone... tab come completely left sort ugly goo scratch smear off. way get bubbles package come card help remove bubbles. used 3 5 screens far look horrible. sure others gave one star. 
 there's reason cheap - guessed, find better one, do. seller probably trying get rid inventory loss.- size off; doesn't cover glass entirely - it's narrow long. comes protectors, even half mm pain. that's even know put on, you're gonna go make adjustment wrong sizing. went two.- plastic super cheap fingers glide it. means get sticky, like there's kind glue it. also means you're gonna able get bubbles out. still two small bubbles can't push underneath.- probably biggest problem - plastic film cheap rainbow effect; look angles, see rainbow unevenness going across horizontally. it's like see mix water gasoline. it's annoying.save trouble disappointment - don't buy product. 
 terrible protection glossy bubbles ridiculously horrible. came pack five went 2 days. sucks 
 horrible quality, get pay for. reminds plastic comes fruit roll up. never buy again, bought something else shipped together thought free ones sent compliment. 
 waste money put white paper tab put phone can't get stupid tabs them. 
 "protectors" love smudges oil fingers. protect screen, major disappointment. look elsewhere. 
 left lot bubbles applying. spent good amount time trying work still remain. writing 16 month old daughter pulled phone sooo aren't sticky either. i'll throwing out. waste money. don't buy. 
 five protectors bent would adhere iphone edges. poor quality. i'd rate zero stars allowed. 
 took forever receive since come china. also, almost impossible install without getting speck dust air bubble it. looks like crap. buy good case. 
 like product. difficult apply screen. air bubbles terrible get screen. 
 screen protectors came part combo purchase recommended amazon. ordered charge/sync cord wall charger iphone best price available included screen protectors. needed replace one phone scratch, nothing minor putting off. arrived pulled old protector, cleaned screen phone carefully started put first one. apparently came dust already attached sticky side ended small bubble protector. also noticed noticeable kind swirly rainbow look lights office. decided since got five would try again. managed get bit crooked first try discovered rainbow effect again. since three left decided give one last try. got straight time ended piece dust underside protector rainbow effect still there.don't waste money these. threw last two away. 
 didn't work even charged 24 hours. tried many ways nothing. included headset wall charger. instruction manual included. returned seller expense shipping charge. waiting full refund seller said so. 
 plantronics 220 doesnt work. pairs, connects, gives static filled connection even holding phone hand two feet away. garbage. plantonics voyager 510 - thats headset-- leave phone thirty feet away goes two walls distance. 220- garbage. also, beware buying called motorola bluetooth earpieces 'bay auction site. mostly counterfeit work poorly real plantronics 220. 
 wanted date last review. still haven't recieved order apprently lost mail company said may 20 would resend order. three day shipping info see 
 work! buy stuff sold by: oem shopthey mailed 2 different cable damage! 
 many third-party cables, doesn't fit phone well original. one got feels "gritty" attaching it, like it's grinding connectors shouldn't be. known better.update: expected, broke normal usage less 1 month. avoid. 
 good.this product never worked advertised.when plug computer get warning iphone quote. "this device supported iphone"so thought hmm maybe telling truth(iphone) left hooked 6 hours charge 1 %.the company contacted last negative review gave product. sent another. review second one.i give one wants them. opps first one trash. use product doesn't advertised do. 
 cable went bad month $3 bucks guess cant complain. spend extra $$ buy original. 
 hurts ear,where corner back side presses ear starts hurt, sound ok best, wont get loud enoff. 
 although comfortable headset ever worn, one could hear unless angles juuuuust right face. worst all, unless phone 2 ft away headset, stay connected. either hold phone place shirt pocket. returned 1 week.i recommend headset. 
 sound 20 longer current model, price dropped significantly--i paid around $20 mine. price good bargain anyone wants plain vanilla headset decent sound quality. find sound excellent--far superior bluetooth headset i've used. device simple thus easy use, design notch better devices there. fit, device sits ear rather it, though optional ear loop. find nestles comfortably ear don't notice it's there. downsides it's current model number things can't do, addition find range great--sound degrades rapidly earpiece direct line phone device.the device one multicolored led difficult see looking directly it. mine came original packaging additional ear pieces black blue can't comment color. need headset (earpiece) calls (no music) live without voice recognition, good buy.update changed review three one star: product ok worked item's internal battery stopped holding charge less year. even though moderately inexpensive, that's substandard performance opinion since item worthless can't hold charge. 
 got acc stop end may. daughter stay connected. probably charged phone maybe 6 times since doesn't use much. died vacation never accepted charge back up. bad battery. 
 searched samsung galaxy s3 charger product popped up. received mail even fit phone. 
 cables great stuffing bag, using home car. they're stiff, cables thin enough avoid bulky.** update **after strange charging issues last months, i've determined cables carry data little charge, regardless whether power coming battery pack, wall wart, car charger, single usb port, y-cabled double usb port.on hand, it's strong flexible enough tie door open. 
 cables look like primary picture. extremely short big head it. look every picture, end fault. alternatively, shouldn't look every picture primary picture complete false advertisement looks like.the cord also falls phone easily. don't bump it.i would end losing money return this, i'm stuck it. best advice give spend little money get one actually looks like falsely lead believe look like.the shipping took 2 weeks well. track items company. emailing them, got email back saying, "it end week, way us know when". 2 weeks 3 - 5 business days. 
 bought use charge cell phone, plugged left overnight. next morning, said fully charged,unplugged charged even bit... may work some, didn't work me! 
 cable work galaxy s4. clearly samsung oem (which obvious price) work makes piece garbage. 
 cable didn't work got - pinching correct spot phone end seemed make work, obviously internally defective.seller immediately refunded me. 
 hard make charging cable? bought two galaxy nexus nexus 7, don't work. tried car charger ac charger (both work extremely well cables). car charger got nothing, ac charger one would work ac wiggled enough, nothing. worked usb instead ac. got results galaxy nexus nexus 7. absolute junk, stay away. 
 sent charging cords three different places hoping one would work samsung sii phone. one charge all. one ordered wireless hub, brooklyn, ny worked immediately. 
 stopped working week. get pay for. least dollars. 
 work zte warp samsung preval. order (6) i'm stuck shame me! 
 weeks broke! it's really hard find cheap quality replacement usb cable. one. 
 cheap! flimsy! worth even low price, waste money. lasted maybe week. even worth returning. 
 received cable immediately noted deviated pictured obviously cheap, fake cable. used although unfortunately necessitates removing sgs3 speck case. today discovered months occasional use, stopped transmitting data all. back using original cable came phone.do favor, pay little bit more, buy quality motorola branded cable. 
 bad samsung imitation. work. cable get loose connection doesn't work. though deal time failed. 
 cable dont work...im dissapointed , cable junk, cannot believe sent cable doesnt work , waste money time!!!!!! ahhhhhhrrrr s*** 
 horrible. stretch long all. wanted plug phone wall, would sit floor. plug usb worked one phone. 
 aware product.it's real samsung product. ordered 4 cables every serial numbers same.it's really faked one may break phone.the pin tight use long time, phone's usb jack would fit genuine samsung usb cable.shame hongkong!i'm going claim now!update 5/4/12: got email seller refunded full amount keep one star review faked one (useless). 
 got replace charger cable thos cable waste money, order charge phone certain angle, tried wife's phone wiggle find right angle witch charge phone. smart spend little get better cable. 
 bough single cable work all. price cheap went ahead ordered two more. worked perfectly. guess doesn't make decision easier huh? 
 bought pair cables took almost 3 weeks arrive expected issues there. first arrived doa, never worked. second died shortly less week use. cables short barely reach anywhere. forced inside phone connector made cringe every time. looking charging cable, look elsewhere, even two dollars, cables simply worth it. 
 failed approximately six months use. would buy future. would come better purchasing one store. 
 like others said reviews, cable seem well-made all. tried use past several weeks. sometimes charges sometimes doesn't--when does, charges slowly--like 4 hours go 40% 100%. half time, computer doesn't even recognize phone plugged in. recommend product. 
 equipment obviously samsung product. takes bare minimum 2 hours (uninterrupted) charging time get full charge cable even batter dies quicker usual. would recommend product anyone else. purchased 2 horrible 
 cords looked good got them. decent quality, especially paid. used connect galaxy s4 computer. phone said charging computer never able connect. big deal since figured i'd use usb plugs next bed whatnot. woke next morning phones battery percentage actually gone down! figured messed accidentally turned power strip something. wasn't case maybe didn't plug phone good enough. decided take one work keep plugging many things none working connected s4 computer took note time battery percentage. one hour battery went 2%!! what! giving cords benefit doubt time time finally found best place them, trash can. thanks nothing. 
 despite description pictures "samsung" usb data cable, received generic micro usb cable bears resemblance whatsoever pictured line. would purchased known would receive cheap generic substitute instead. 
 actually discharged samsung note 2. bought 3 none worked. haven't checked see access pictures music phone yet, point meaningless. buy cords charge. 
 completely re-written review. cable works devices except google nexus 4. bought three cables, none work nexus 4. however, cables seem charge transfer data nexus 7, motorola droid 4, & samsung galaxy tab 3. connect cable nexus 4, phone would sporadically charge disconnect every seconds.do buy concerned device incompatible cable. 
 cables don't even charge phones. tell aren't official micro-usb end thicker plastic official samsung cables. bought seller named touch global. ended shipping pakistan somewhere, cant bother return i'll count loss pay proper quality next time. 
 maybe didn't read description thouroughly enough cord sure didnt work samsung precedent phone prepaid/pay-as-you-go plans. disappointed couple bucks... 
 charger broek within two days getting help returning falty. would recomend 
 seller amamax shipping junk 3 foot generic charging cable. cable break within week. micro usb end let loose insulation render cable useless almost immediately. others good luck oem products, amamax ship oem products, take week ship it... 
 bought charge nexus devices (4 7), maintain constant connection. plugged nexus 4 using cables, charging notification flickers, suggesting constantly losing connection reconnecting. doesn't happen micro usb cables i've used. 
 fake. even get phone recognize cord, takes something like 12 16 hours fully charge. absolutely acceptable. 
 again, product description says oem samsung ... data cable... cannot get work unless "giggle" connection phone. i've tried phones get problem. give trying find mini usb cable connect properly samsung phone. 
 came date good thing it. short isn't worst problem ! doesn't stay phone. takes phone forever charge. i'm charger makes percent go instead 
 brought 3 around house. first one worked fine 3 months failed (no charge, data). switched charger still charge. tried using two (both still original packaging). didn't worked. would transfer data charge phone battery. put original phone charge cable charger worked fine knew cable charger. make sure, tried several chargers. nothing. threw three out. total waste money. it's 3 months could return order. buy again. would give zero star possible. disappointed. 
 seriously, don't make last. pretty sure went two three these. thought made great find replacement cable gs2. threw away. would connect well loose wouldn't charge. hardest time finding right cable. ironically found amazing short super long one work awesome. short nokia ca-101d 8-inch connectivity cable nokia (search amazon) connects well solid. also work gs3 don't own. long mediabridge high speed usb 2.0 a-male micro-b cable - 6 feet (also amazon) amazing quality, increadibly long! good luck searching. hopefully two suggestions help find answer. 4 5 different micro usb chargers two mentioned best!!!!! 
 bad quality, short, thin breakable. recommend buying blue rigger 6ft usb cable. cheaper much much better quality. don't waste money this. 
 it's even worse phone pocket bend over, sound (sometimes) cut every second two i'm holding phone 18" away. checking motorola warranty, really disappointing. 
 originally bought s9's, sounded o.k., failed one 30 minute workout moderate sweating. said review going try jaybird's, liked s9's much decided try s9 hd's instead. read s9 hd's much improved sweat resistance. true.on positive, say comparison s9's s9 hd's far sound quality. hd's simply blow older model away. happy initially, although paranoid earlier short lived experience, found constantly wiping headphones make sure didn't get wet working out. well, even didn't work. sadly 3 workouts, failed. time headphones still function, well volume controls, however pause, phone, forward/back controls failed. sigh...i really want like headphones, obviously appropriate product want use workouts. least decency fail within 30 day return period!this time actually order jaybirds instead. know don't audio quality do, hopefully function week!update: looked review morning, decided harsh rating 1 star (although can't go back change that). really good far sound quality, aren't using workouts, probably really like them. it's time ever use headphones workouts, least unacceptable. 
 decided totally rewrite review. finally started using hoping could cope worst bluetooth range ever seen date, sorry, can't take it.pros:the sound quality great. it's best i've ever bluetooth headphones.i haven't sweat problems gym like people seem had.they lightweight, although would nicer lower could lay on.cons:the rubber glue holding power button rubber unglued itself.the battery life 5 hours... bad size, really great either.motorola technical support worst ever conceived, it's joke even call that.they bend pretty easy - take road trip, make sure don't /any/ weight them. mine bent left pretty heavy took time bend back.but real meat potatoes worst wireless range history wireless.i put phone hood get sound cut nonstop. pockets? sorry, sol. like working out? works, kind of. biking phone pocket long lost dream. didn't buy - ht820 (which way amazing compared these) went warranty, sent back. charger, manual, nothing box (and weren't even bubble wrapped!) contacted it, said warranty expired. might due fact took nearly 3 weeks get response. getting rma previous set bad never buying motorola again.overall, really dislike headphones practical use. look 1 star reviews, you'll see have.i cannot repeat enough: buy these, save horrors piece trash (for lack better words)update: upgraded nokia bh-905i - like bt headphones i'm going throw money away another pair losers. sound doesn't cut (new) phone new pair - still old (these). upgrade phone (from wrote top part review), tested bt range, sadly, problem lie headphones. want like them, problems, nothing like. 
 first bluetooth headset bought. first days worked ok noticed recharge every couple hours used. started hearing lot static noice (i walking around, sitting next laptop). bottom line, don't waste money, reason headset cheap. knows maybe expensive one better job. 
 actually kept turning dont know reason yea didnt work really bad one ! sorry 
 bought product link 6 months ago, one ok. latest purchase, however, lasted 3 weeks, hold charge, drops rapidly zero couple hours. again, one six months ago fine phone. 
 recently ordered new battery another seller friends g1 longer holding charge. battery worked better expected. g1 battery began die quickly even limited use figured i'd get new battery mine well. battery work well ordered. battery seems work bad original one i've years.when received it, 70% life decided fully charge let completely die recharging. i've using days charge fully night. end day, around 5 6pm me, it's less 20%. rarely use phone day i'm work. even tried taking autosync feature save battery life. last night usual fully charged battery. i've checked email received/sent text messages. it's noon battery 44%!i believe lower priced batteries actually work. don't think one them. try risk. i'm thankful didn't spend alot this. 
 ordered phone days ago arrived today. initially excited got package fast even though took advantage using free shipping. soon:my excitement turned suspicion, surprise finally angry:(suspicion) box felted bit light(surprise) seal box broken(angry) phone inside box!!!it manual wall charger phone. ridiculous, even april fools' day yet!i contacted amazon immediately another phone way door. purchased countless items amazon, new used, never received empty box. appreciate amazon's effort resolving problem quickly, still looks amazon getting comfortable #1 e-retailer long, wake up, amazon.com! 
 ordered pair these. one lasted single charge, second didn't work all. could given product zero stars, would have. worth postage return - kept removable usb cables, threw adapters away. 
 bought reading good review it. well, good quality. however, thick stay loose phone. point good quality cover sit tie phone use it? well, can't use it, cheap return, threw away. recommend it. 
 heard bose version style product could afford $300, tried $50 version.1st: battery cover flimsy: difficult snap afraid going break it.2nd: stream horrible. maybe got lemon, every 2 three seconds sound would stop start again... irritating.3rd: blinking blue night also huge irritation! stop blinking make steady.------------------my wallet said, &#34;spracht!!!&#34; coughed dough toy. 
 husband & using at&t; - i'm iphone, not. resisted getting iphone & met couple years ago, experienced dropped calls rarely. whenever speaking, speaking anyone else iphone, lose signal 3 times minimum re-dial. notorious problem iphone experienced minor improvement software updates.i frequently lose signal strength areas greater dfw metroplex. anxious try kit could make phone accessible (ie, flopping around passenger seat next emergency brake) reduced dropped calls.there adhesive mount a/c vent mount included. learned experience never put adhesive dash. live texas sun comes summer, volcanos send sympathy cards asphalt! adhesive turn runny, sticky unable hold onto anything weight postage stamp car sits hot texas sun. i've always strongly mechanically inclined fiddle a/c vent mount 45 minutes finally threw hands air modest defeat. decided ok hang one side bounce around - could get better signal strength.in fairness, new vw beetle... known large sloping dashes, steep angled windshields, etc. may good way mount beetle 'universal' kit.sliding phone cradle getting properly mount 30 pin connector one-handed procedure. take mount a/c vent pull plastic front get iphone 3gs finally properly seat onto connector. frustrating trying get cradle onto vent, trying remove it.i watched video, followed instructions step step mounted magnetic antenna. disappointed see antenna came kit wired matter mounted antenna, access cable someone could vandalize. live city like dallas, people cut cords fun. ran lengthy (nice length routing along door/floor trim) cable seat side interior beetle ran cord top hatch back rubber trim protected cord crimped. small antenna strong magnet - strong enough keep thing mounted even strong winds. sometimes go mall shopping put jacket top things don't want people getting tempted by. cunning thief need tug antenna notice cord, pull cradle along car interior move jacket way see underneath. no, won't able pull whole kit-n-kaboodle car without breaking glass, something think about. kit provides list available antennas, including glass mount would avoid problems, acquired kit. it' shame glass mount antenna included get-go.after going frustration, drove around made calls. areas know typically get less 5 bars, saw improvement. i'd unseat phone pop cradle - familiar charging beep could heard battery symbol showed lightning bolt - seated - antenna securely attached, cable crimped - improvement. improvement, two people called said echo talked. minute i'd pull phone cradle, echo would go away. using apple-provided earbuds, speaker phone.during demo video, viewer clearly see improvement signal strength. saw improvement. could car area live, know underwhelmed either way frustrated difficulty getting iphone cradle (this without case phone, course) trying mount cradle car. 
 put new battery cellphone waste money. cellphone dies every day battery low. don't bother buying this. 
 don't waste time. item came ripped arrived never fit old iphone. keep looking something else! 
 wanted something sturdier protect iphone. thought flimsy sturdy enough protection. would recommend case. 
 product terrible, cut up, smelled bad, fit phone like promised. would recommend people purchase. get otterbox yeah range 15-50$ amazon protect phone greatly otterboxes best cases around. 
 cheap also cheap made, better idea spend money get better product would say 
 didn't like product all. feels super cheap didn't provide drop protection. better cases price range. 
 nice color, thats it. texture/ material made rough slip jean pockets. kinda slipped around phone, also collected much lint materials... wouldnt get 
 it's perfect condition slides phone i'm using way. it's apple iphone 3gs. 
 received worked probably first 4 times zipper broke. would use zipper twice day disappointed broke quickly. guess get pay enexpensive material well. 
 way big carry pocket (unless it's big jacket pocket. needed place put bluetooth would protect could keep pocket wouldn't lose 3rd (or 4th) bluetooth headset. useful somebody large purse keep losing headset - you'll find puppy!so i'm still looking something keep bluetooth headset i'm using want quick access. 
 sadly,. though description says plantronics voyager pro headset fits case - not. even close. unfortunately discarded packaging cannot return three purchased. fault. also, zipper closure tight point almost impossible open close. lesson learned - order 1, check fit, keep packaging return fit description wrong. 
 cousin got phone, 2 replacements never wet even abused phone any. screen going out, turning rainbowish colors. second phone seems working, neither us seem think impressive phone 
 cheap. small childred didn't cost much. wasn't long broken. 
 earphones m&m;'s theme, kind cute idea. looking economic earphones, young children concerned appearance, rather sound quality, might consider them.if want decent sound however, save money look elsewhere. sound quality muddy, heavy bias low end. high frequencies reproduced well, regular music, even hard make vocals. addition, build quality appears cheap side, areas. cord thin, probably prone breakage.perhaps earphones intended small children, package come tiny silicone earbuds attached, small adults wear. larger sized earbuds included (loose inside package, don't lose them). install larger earbud, first need remove tiny one (don't tear it!). technique attaching larger earbud. turn inside out, attach stem speaker, push edges get back proper shape. large sized earbuds installed, get snug fit, probably one cuts much ambient sound.these phones may look cool some, that's positive. reproduce sound well, may last long. fit comfortable, earbuds get torn, probably need buy new earphones, spare set earbuds provided.if looking earphones price range, sound better, better job cutting ambient sound, available variety colors, spare set earpads, take look jvc's marshmallow series. 
 battery original equipment; work phone great choice mother. 
 bought phone didn't even work. happy all. one moments wish would put extra money first time. 
 purchased first bluetooth headset thought cute. bad idea. poor, patchy sound quality speak say echoey hard hear. smaller ears uncomfortable wear. returning different headset. 
 knew could make basic thing cutting piece cardbard size, would saved order hassle. flimsy item can't believe positive reviews. wife thought trash threw away left counter. doesn't adjust securely hold droid. purchased take family self portraits didn't hold proper angle. comfortable risking droid's safety placing thing. cetainly wouldn't try interact droid's screen holder. 
 didn't like product. wasn't sturdy ended sending right back. don't waste money one. 
 piece plastic crease center quasi folds. silicon "feet'? silicon scraps pushed called feet. sure, don't slip, soon put pressure ipod, thing collapses. junk. pure, marketing junk. nothing load bollocks. metal, would something easily made piece packaging plastic, wish known flimsy would be. there's effort spent company branding materials. never again. 
 office, years, used theplantronics cs70/hl10 dect 6.0 bundle wireless headset system lifterand love it. fits perfectly, full volume microphone adjustments don't notice me.i also used theplantronics voyager 510 bluetooth headset [retail packaging] primary headset previous motorola razr loved it. however, switched iphone 3gs, people couldn't hear well anymore.upon first using voyager pro, person sounded digitized 510. also, biggest problem headset -- person sounds quiet, tinny distant. tried various earpieces without felt cover, same. comparing 510 model, 510's earpiece goes much deeper ear canal, getting speaker deeper in, creating better sound sealing sounds. even pushing voyager pro, earpiece collapses instead going deeper in.i hearing issues volume way windows car. windows down, would impossible hear.i wasn't impressed controls voyager pro compared 510 either. power button difficult find push compared 510. volume button difficult distinguish one another. 510, different slope, making easy know which. answer/hang up/voice dial button forces smash whole headset ear canal activate difficult know whether pressing it. 510, could hear button pushed let could easily counteract force thumb behind, keeping earpiece crushing ear.this usable me, returning it. back drawing board. 
 bluetooth lasted less week... 15 really interested dual speaker clarity pick up. worth price, setup flimsy cheap. broke quickly... 
 go lot head sets going one going different-as going send back! thing big might well try tape phone ear. behind ear that! big feels (too me) someone tugging ear! uncomfortable actually painful!sound quality? maybe bad one? static filled, loud enough clear. sometimes phone pocket work clearly. 3 feet away!now real downside....i good recommendation but, ordered 5 different brands/types tried before.someone make good bluetooth headset. endeavor find one. 
 couple months headset give bad review. perform well iphone often callers say speech sounds warbled scratchy. further, it's uncomfortable wear feels heavy behind ear. also cannot wear sunglasses it.i get much better mic quality either holding iphone ear without headset, using wired one came it.i regret purchase plantronics. 
 best sound useability replaced several times warranty. guess one occasional user 5 star one heavy user i.e. daily user - many one stars. would fix failures would clear winner. 
 warned microusb cable cannot used sync wm6.5 smart phones pc. htc pure won't work cable, works fine original cable comes phone device. apparently microusb cables same.

 bought mifi thinking would swap aircard i've using verizon several years. attracted ability 5 devices share one connection.overall device allow 5 devices share connection. speeds decent - averaging 1.5 mb.the problem device constantly disconnects internet forced wait re-connect. it's something everyone would notice (you watch going control panel ip address 192.168.1.1).there also really odd problems able update firmware mac, able initially turn device work ac power (i've always start unplugged it's connected attach power cord).i think really cheap product would avoid. it's probably near end-of-life much better (and faster) alternatives coming (see sprint 4g novatell).before buy - quick web search issues around model. found many wish i'd known made purchase. 
 purchased ulike, digitizer arrived month defective.... several emails pictures later asked get &#34;professional&#34; install, sorry pay someone $50 install $5 screen 30$ phone, perfectly competent enough install 3g digitizer done 10~ 3g/3gs without error, countless iphone 4/4s. give money back ordered ebay 3.99 2 day shipping free 
 extrememly unimpressed product! speaker cable fit right, could hear phone unless speaker. earpiece speaker would plug board correctly. 
 shipping prompt courteous item. really, really nothing complain about, don't blame seller much, product defective. shuffle didn't charge, couldn't detected computer. going bother returning it, money spent, it's worth time aggravation. worth it. 
 doesn't work 4th generation ipod shuffle. charging adapters don't even work. total piece mung. avoid. also need 20 words post review. really amazon? prime guys 20 word thing? said everything needed say product less 20 words. 
 wow. thought couldnt loose price. wrong! pens scratched ruined screen protector! knows would actual ipad screen! $2.59. spend $25 new screen protector!! wish could give 0 stars! 
 amend original review (see below) owning item several months. bought juice pack air october, despite others' complaints signal strength, sync working, fragile build quality, hadn't experienced trouble these, gave four stars early review.i've dropped problems. continuing, note least two revisions device there; know i've two different revisions.problem 1: original juice pack air, micro-usb connector broke two months. sad very, satisfied product moment. found one two people around web mention this, two months purchase, micro-usb connector case disappeared inside one evening went plug in, spelling doom case. determining couldn't easily open fix soldering iron something, put rma warranty service request via mophie website.service reasonably good. never got human call response, get ups tag. shipped broken case copy receipt using tag (so didn't pay shipping) now, two weeks later, new case arrived. thanks exchange mophie, worrying connector isn't attached substantial way (the replacement case same).problem 2: oddly, replacement case (supposedly exactly product) doesn't fit iphone 3gs nicely original case did. one full 2mm longer (yes, longer) meaning there's big empty gap (enough slide penny in) top phone top case. yes, top seated way. it's also nearly tight. know people complained tightness juice pack air, liked it. one still nicely made, it's much "slide on/slide easily" affair. case feels less though snugly protect phone.problem 3: replacement unit indeed kill signal strength (as others reported) way first unit didn't. wonder they've changed revisions causes this?problem 4: sync charge behavior frustratingly different new unit well. clearly highly different revisions piece equipment there. first juice pack air, sync worked transparently mophie attached (just plug computer saw it) charging easy, since left switch bottom "on" position time forgot it. plugging usb, juice pack iphone would charge full time. unplugging, juice pack would discharge first, iphone. now, charging sync behaviors different.first, sync longer works juice pack attached (a problem many others had). second, charging works like this:- plug juice pack (either switch position), actual iphone doesn't charge time (before, matter whether switch red green, iphone juice pack would charge parallel plugged in). now, plugged iphone continues discharge eventually go flat, even juice pack busily charges.- set switch green charge actual iphone, must unplug juice pack power charging occur (if it's plugged switch green, iphone charge). green red, moment plug juice pack back power, iphone stops charging, matter switch position. basically: charge juice pack plugged power (not iphone). charge iphone plugged power (and then, obviously, can't charge juice pack).getting full charge full flat thus requires following steps replacement unit:1. plug juice pack. wait charge (meanwhile, iphone goes dead stays dead).2. disconnect power, flip juice pack green. wait iphone charge (meanwhile, juice pack runs charges).3. reconnect juice pack, replace charge used (of course, plugged in, iphone stopped charging running juice pack charges).in short, it's literally impossible actually get full charge time unless take pack iphone charge separately. first juice pack air (the one broke replaced warranty) behave way.i suspect changed behavior complaints i've read overheating batteries charging time. didn't experience problem first juice pack, though get quite warm.in case, new review this: i'll continue use thing bought provide extra power. it's kind grudging acceptance frustration rather enthusiasm, i'm tempted try get ahold one competing (and discontinued, doubt due similar types problems) incase power slider units see they're better.maybe there's way right apple consider releasing "extended battery" version iphone that's twice thick $200 more? i'd pay gave double battery life without "power case" nonsense.----------------------------------------original review:so sitting apple store manhattan trying find single case protected sync port bottom iphone. couldn't find one. find mophie juice pack air less twice price basic black silicone cases sold store."not bad," thought, wanted read review see whether thing good, particularly since apple store didn't open one display least inspect build quality. reviews complained loss signal strength, much lower advertised battery power, and/or inability sync without removing iphone mophie.i contemplated, bought, knowing could always return hated it. immediately upon buying, went straight nearest horizontal surface, opened it, installed it. then, plugged usb port laptop.(1) signal strength degradation (knock wood).(2) computer found iphone happy syncing (knock wood).(3) later experience shown gives good 70% boost battery length (knock wood).apart that, think build quality complaints really baseless. beautifully finished, solid, nicely fitting (incredibly precise tolerances) piece equipment. complaining sound like they're removing case daily. warning: it's clearly designed removed replaced again, tell looking it. plan remove iphone time, case you. (and thus, plan use iphone kinds docks docking accessories, case you.)this thing clearly intended people good coverage areas use iphone mostly go, don't ready pile iphone accessories require docking, need nice cover boost operation time.the reasons give four stars rather five: idea long battery's lifetime be; lot lesser rechargeable batteries tend wear 20-30 cycles, haven't yet gotten mophie, also, micro usb cable comes damned short (like, foot half, literally) buy usb extension cable. make cable longer, guys. 
 *** april 23rd update: unfortunately power switch unit failed within 4 weeks (and light use) - switch gradually moved deeper inside unit one day separated completely rattled around inside case reduced review four one star. idea great build quality unit clearly substandard. confidence replacement fare better since seems design flaw - trying get money back mophie claim techngnet's problem solve (the original seller), techngnet claim mophie's problem. afraid advice buy case mophie unless willing flush seventy bucks drain.*** original review: little hesitant buy battery case based feedback, knew still needed something help 3gs busy day. disabled push used 3g sparingly order nurse phone whole day still ended low battery warnings 4pm days.i already seperate battery clumsy carry (plus cable) day charging night required organization capable of. researching alternatives decided mophie air best bunch available today, even though concerns possible drawbacks.i received mophie 2 weeks ago happy far. knew issues ahead time expectations set accordingly.what works:the form factor great - makes iphone chunky guess - actually feels better way easier hold use! materials seem ok, case doesn't feel cheap doesn't garish brand names emblazoned it, nice low key "mophie" imprinted logo. charge leds job. case snug fits 3gs ok covers whole phone back top. sure much protection really provides better nothing.battery capacity:not amazing recharge dead phone 90% enough long day (or two short ones).convenience:perfect - always ready need it. charging simple, plug night one cable morning fully charged phone case ready day. enable charging low juice flick small recessed switch phone charging back life, easy. syncing works fine microusb cable.drawbacks:cable - yes it's microusb means docks won't work unless slide case time - wasn't really bothered this. extra cables found online pretty cheaply.mute switch - can't unmute case on, need slide top get switch. irritating dealbreaker.reception - haven't noticed big drop signal strength others reported - might slight reduction nothing given trouble (yet?)microusb connector - people complained connector breaks inside phone continued use - haven't problems yet i'm keeping eye open this.price - it's pricy iphone primary tool you'll appreciate convenience investment worth it.best illustrations saved already -1) business call went much longer planned, battery 7% - flicked charger switch mid-call good go rest call (and day).2) writing review starbucks - 20% battery warning came don't care - it's time get mophie going.overall completely solved battery anxiety made iphone dependable device day - highly recommended.i confirmed blackberry micro usb data cables work fine mophie (they charge sync) purchased cheaply amazon. 
 wonder price low, battery pack bad iphone battery fully charged pack fully charged, cannot get even 5 hours use phonei noticed beginning returned item right away.the newtrent used outlast one far 
 bought originally outrageous price $90, thought would worth got full day heavy use iphone. first case worked 3 weeks stopped working (the case would hold charge, transfer charge iphone). returned (in box roomates, whose mophie also stopped working time) received new one, questions asked, nice. new one barely works all. extends life iphone battery hour two doesn't charge phone, doesn't seem work phone battery drops low. example, phone 20%, attach case would normally maybe 30 min talk time, mophie gets 60 minutes, phone dies, even though mophie power meter says juice left. disappointing product. 
 first, prepared loose signal. second case protect phone well. buyer beware! 
 file claim... fraudulent productchineese dungcan mophie suedcan mophie suedcan mophie suedcan mophie sued 
 mophie ashamed. case protect phone well loose signal battery case on. buyer beware! 
 used original mophie juice pack 3g. 6 9 months & wore wouldn't take charge. outer appearance deteriorated then, performed end. perfectly satisfied. got 3gs juice pac air came out, got one right away. 3 months & it's busted. cable problem got replaced website. today, connector case longer connects cable. tried new cable, old cable & wife's cables & nothing. lights, itunes, phone vibrating, nothing. it's 3 months. don't know it's design, build quality micro usb connector. (the mini usb connector fine & tested years don't know changed it)don't buy battery case. go back juice pack wait next generation. 
 bought run 3rd gen ipod touch. relatively comfortable, although would definitely prefer ear bud. problem ear buds run sweat makes slip out, good alternative. downside don't really get loud enough--the volume control kind limited. otherwise, need inexpensive, wireless headset work out, i'd recommend. you're looking great sound listening enjoyment, look elsewhere.update: return headphones; volume control stopped working altogether could never get music get external noise around me. skip these...there better products there! plan get sony ericsson bluetooth ear buds... 
 work great using buttons headphones feels like could fail given time. buttons work though i'm going judge think happen. i'll downgrade explain issue they're good bang buck beats getting tangled gym.dropped 4 3 stars short battery life foam keeps falling off.edit:don't know last edit didn't stick, stopped working 3 months occasional use. able return partial refund. steer clear! 
 headphones year static started coming left ear piece. loud painful. even turned keeps making static. nothing i've tried rectified it. guess it's time new pair headphones, won't motorola. 
 i've two pair now. work perfect me, months stopped working. mainly use riding bike, maybe sweat problem. first set stopped working, thought something. second set stopped manner. 
 problem 1 - bought details said would pair 2 devices time. followed directions paired iphone 4s turned off, turned headphones back paired ipad 2. turned everything off. turned iphone ipad back finally headphones would connect 1 device. wanted able watch videos ipad still answer phone these. could that.problem 2 - happend decided try iphone listen music, music sounded fine made phone calls echo person end told sounded terrible. tried restarting everything still problem.problem 3 - wearing 2 hours ears killing me, uncomfortable!needless say returned day got them. 
 really bad battery life, connection lost often liked. buy thing again. what's more, i'm sure buy bluetooth headsets again. 
 purchased headphones really hard corded kind, find needing replace every year two. bluetooth headset seemed like way go. unfortunately, turn case. sound quality decent, charge time okay, sadly, thing cannot maintain bluetooth connection iphone. every minutes, connection weakens, sound stutters even cuts seconds. given keep phone shirt pocket, distance phone headphones less 2 feet, yet connection fails. i'd call reliable product. would definitely buy again. total waste money. 
 months stopped accepting charge. sound quality good expected last longer 
 cheap plastic band goes behind head huge sticks like wing behind neck. look up, hits neck moves heaphones. band adjustable - big design flaw.also, max volume level horrible - easily hear noise around turned way up. 
 bad choice want get music.bad choice want use sony bluetooth supporting phone (like sony walkman series. latest phone)i understand dont expect good bose 30 bucks, jwin comes price, gives better quality.i think motorola never good music earphones thing.with sony phone (& sometime iphone too), quality bad.sound like interrupted every seconds.come on, 2010. bluetooth magic, work !! 
 need average cranium, sound super, microphone tinny people hard time hearing me. go long way phone retain connection though! 
 liked everything headset. wore gym worked sweat. everything fine finished workout tried turn off. nothing happened - held power button kept blinking. let run power (and dry out) charged again. worked fine 30 minutes. worked sweat, started cutting finally made buzzing noise wouldn't turn off. let dry worked fine two days. went back gym sure enough, worked sweat started cutting started buzzing. got fed stomped threw remains nearest trash can. wish sent back refund, lost temper.in case, excellent stopped working properly. 
 bought headphones january 2012. worked well couple month started bad times return window closed. automatically disconnected phone without reason. worked well skype sometimes. need connect headphone start skype app iphone log-in. (you need follow order). it'll work first call make. want hang make another skype call, disconnect headset, log skype follow steps again. finally, + volume controller stopped working. couldn't use anymore. bad! 
 used month running, ran 50 miles. sweat light mist month (never run rain) caused go out. don't buy expectation even somewhat rugged. don't know else somebody would use exercising... 
 reading good reviews amazon, finally decided buy headphone itouch (with latest 3.1.2 firmware) wanted wireless headphone freedom offers. got day ordering using amazon's prime shipping. charged headphone completely (until green light came) also paired easily ipod also laptop. soon hearing experience, started getting pauses listening itouch. audio lagged many times even full charge disgusted returning back product. also ear fit uncomfortable doubt anyone wear product 30 mins more. all, poor product disappointed me. 
 disappointed. item work right retail box. charge light came red never changed green. headphones would power on. looking forward these. processed refund (and grateful amazon process). reorder see reviewers, somebody know bought headphones, overall product quality poor experience uncommon. 
 motorola s305 surprisingly sound good kinivo bth220 (also sold names). kinivo also consistently easier time connecting iphone. however, motorola s305 looks feels better kinivo, appears durable.i would given s305 4 stars, three months ownership, + volume button completely broken. - button works fine. experienced similar problem another motorola model, problem took year manifest. no, drop abuse headphones. hardly even used volume buttons since controlling volume phone usually sufficient.these headphones going trash. 
 excited opening package. reading directions, plugged unit charge, waited, waited, waited. unit never charged. sent back. gave one star - bad quality control - disappointed. 
 head set band twists back ear cups separate away ears. band also goes behind ears presses back ears uncomfortable. one may molded really bad. keeps disconnecting phone phone 2 feet away. keep shopping around. 
 poor battery life... it's supposed extended high capacity battery life battery like regular battery came phone, sucks. buy!!how send battery back !!!!!!!! 
 used device successfully two weeks prongs broke end attaches phone. unfortunately, couple days passed "return" period luck. buyer beware! thankfully, $5. 
 supposed auto shut-off phone reaches full charge. plugged night, phone showed charging, went bed. next morning, phone dead. lost 30% charge overnight, charging. next night plug charger, doesn't work! total garbage. bought two them, less! maybe one work? i'm holding breath. 
 tool job original sim card tray tool apple. cheap cutout. buy want original one apple. don't care scratch aluminum coating phone inserting tool phone buy it. want keep phone pristine beautiful condition, don't waste time cheap product. 
 pin super fragile! forget metal all. entered sim card area remove sim card tray thing snapped! it's complete waste money time!

 good product usb cable work perfect like oem cable. . . 
 well, went internet first....$14.00, well known store, gloucester, ma, $28. happy. then, course, knew amazon would come something...they did, $4.00 change...it arrived promptly. cannot say enough amazon, realistic prices, knowing people kind money pay wire,,for 14 28 dollars. never happy get need without spending last dollar it. thank again. 
 would like extra cable smartphones work, purchased one. nothing special long working, is.no complain. 
 difference usb cables. computers, including mine, usb ports underpowered, poor cables transmit data well. purchased cheaper cables would transmit data computer blackberry storm 9530. cable works great, even underpowered usb ports. 
 phone cord easy use easily connected phone computer. great value price. 
 cable better original. never issues phone recognizing usb connection, original does, plugged pc. 
 bought recently expect much, $2.99 shipped door. much money, go wrong? so, used transfer data yet, plugged pc work charging. plugged in, palm pixi prompts me, factory cable does, transfer charge. used cable 10x charge now, works great! hesitate purchase need another cable, two! 
 good inexpensive cable works like original. purchased cable wanted one would work touch stone purchased. reading several reviews looking competing cables deciding one. several inches shorter (40") original works well touch stone. used cable mainly use car. 
 much say wall charger except charges bluetooth perfectly. i'm glad bought it. thank you! 
 charger trick. charger car doesn't work ignition off, wants dangling cord hanging field vision driving.have charged t505 since got it, battery life reported around 18 hours usage 30 days standby. may charge every couple weeks. convenient accessory. 
 motorola t505 doesn't come ac charger, dc charger. makes great addition package. charge home night. 
 initially leary purchasing item due extremely low price free shipping also, needed wall charger since motorola includes car charger wireless car phone speakers. took chance (due low price free shipping) pleasantly surprised. charger appears well made market chargers purchased previously e-book reader, pda, camera, etc., less 25% cost. charged motorola speaker without problems. 
 bought charging cord t505 came car charger. 2 t505 2nd one intended use connecting bluetooth enabled phones home stereo. cord offers convenient way charge car long enough periods device charge completely travelling. bringing devices able charge overnight full charge. great price complaints receipt material either packaging transit time. 
 it's true! cable outperforms original! charge phone, it's chargier. data datery phone phoney general. wear cable around neck like bolo tie, people like better run faster jump higher. circle dinner plate it, food tastes better. basically cable makes everything better original. i'm thinking getting 2nd one! 
 clearly htc cable blackberry logo bulk packaging label says blackberry...but it's oem micro usb cable none less works perfectly micro usb device plugged into.while haven't tested it's speed cables doubt outperforms oem cable works that's asked it.the cable bit thick result stiff unmanageably so.it also noted cable shown picture actual product, mini usb cable appears quite bit longer product, cable 1m long. 
 trust htc accessories htc phones bad luck aftermarket products cheaper, cheap expensive. 
 i'll never understand one review say item works exactly next complains working...for exact phone! don't get it. decided try despite people said didn't work, i'm glad did. it's exactly expected wanted. actually bought 2 could leave one car one work. $4 change both...this great buy never worry incredible running battery!

 using coby ca-747 cassette adapter 2 years use car stereo play audio dvd-player cd-player. lately, car tape player kept rejecting out. thought broken buy product amaonz again. reading people's reviews, bump r. penny's feedback 10/26/05 "skip" mode following:"one thing keep mind using product like - (but all) car tape players "skip" mode. tape player's "skip" mode active, listens silent portions tape. detects silence seconds, automatically go fast forward "hears" sound again. tape player "skip" mode, sure cancel mode - i.e., put player "normal" play mode. otherwise, find tape player trying "fast forward" silent portions audio feed."this exactly problem having. turning "skip" mode car tape player, car tape player reject coby cassette adapter anymore.again, even indeed broken, buy product again. good product money. 
 bought cassette adapter replace old one who's cord got ripped half stuck door. get better sound one one originally bought twice price.the best part cassette adapter cord coiled, stretched super long (probably least 8 feet although checked) yet tension applied (during normal use storage) cord 3 feet long. keeps getting stuck things like car doors wrapped around steering wheels getting tangled old adapter did.i pleasantly surprised adapter. got money's worth it. 
 works great 2002 honda accord! adapters either gimped frequency range come one speaker. 
 kicks "local order" 2am monday morning said package would still arrive monday. didn't believe it, figured, "i'll pay doesn't arrive time i'll get money back shipping cost" (i mean come on, 300 miles south me!!). 12 hours later package come 300 miles onto doorstep. friends dedication one's time commitment. wow.as far product goes love it! plug stretchy spiral type doesn't hang around getting tangled feet i'm driving. way better last stupid cheap one bought best buy cord wore 2 months. sound quality really bad learn adjust volumes properly. everything expect cassette adapter.in order get volumes adjusted optimal sound quality (without white noise tape players give off), adjust phone mobile music device 75% volume keep plugged in. point use car's volume amplify volume.good luck! 
 cassette player car wanted able plug mp3 player it. adapter looks like cassette wire coming end. slides car player plug mp3 player, plays system problem. trouble yet others written about. went trip 2 weeks ago used several hours. worked great. wire changed come side back, depending way auto player oriented. 
 omg , u tape deck need aux use product , it's exspensive sounds great works mp3 , cd players , phones . got awsome sound !!! way better fm transmitter !!!!! 
 car get used old try's haven't issues since plays music note doesn't sound beautiful might cars speakers though sure. 
 would agree majority reviews. purchased car. don't mp3 connection tape deck. wasn't thrilled quality sound fm tuners (my brother one car). little bit clicking sound appears starts playing, road nose general nose car, non-issue...can't even hear it. quality sound good direct mp3 connection, consider good...(not sure it's even fair compare). use primarily audio books, happy purchase. try fix reviewers (something needing take pin inside cassette).i would definitely recommend! 
 car doesn't ipod connector bought product. using year happy it. works amazingly well. 
 use though phone still warranty cuz us cellular said voided warranty, us cellular worst cell phone carrier there. even needed brand new samsung galaxy s3 did...the instructions could little better complaint

 overall, think it's safe investment mobile phone. one sad thing cell phones improve quickly, there's always race best.right now, phone one best, without 300+ pricetag. you're paying 300 it, aren't getting good deal.clear reception, included ear piece comfortable generics come phone like r225 samsung.great display. downside wiping thing. oils form skin ear show easily pristine surface. clear pictures nice graphics.i give 10 10. 
 i've mine almost two months i'm happy aspects wonderful powerful phone. definitely buy another s-e phone future. still don't like t-mobile's coverage especially service support, phone star. may find teh buttons bit small, well-spaced fine large hands. voice clarity superb me, quality/durability great. 
 used se t610 phone almost 2 months palm zire 72 hp ipaq 4155, must give 5 stars following reasons:1) camera great. pictures come real clear beautiful send via email. please don't judge quality pictures see t610. admit pictures look little fuzzy t610. 2mb memory purpose taking pictures upload send via email others. quality pictures improves dramatically sent viewed via one's pc.2) bluetooth features phone outrageous. paired se t610 using t-mobile's unlimited vpn gprs data service palm zire 72, hp ipaq 4155, logitech mobile wireless bluetooth headset performance great. got bluetooth enabled palm pocket pc, phone you. sony ericsson ground floor bluetooth revolution. send data via pocket pc palm se t610 via bluetooth flash. moreover, web surfing much faster thought via bluetooth.3) absolutely problem signal strength clarity voice calls nyc primarily use phone. go boroughs queens, bronx, manhatten, brooklyn nassau county (with exception garden city) great.people need realize t-mobile extensive network verizon even sprint has. so, looking buy phone use t-mobile network, enthusiastically recommend live nyc (outside staten island). however, need due diligence check advance whether phone perform well service provider area live. 
 i've t610 + tmobile month (so word rebates yet) phone service... i've pretty satisfied. get pretty good reception everywhere... phone small comfortable everything seems work without hitch. camera good enough cell phone... phone pleasing got new games/themes/ringtones via infrared port. phone doesn't much memory deleted predefined themes/songs/graphics (or least ones lets you), gave enough. hasn't frozen yet (and mine came oldest firmware). heard upgrading firmware resolves freezing issues, increases quality/compression pictures, overall makes phone useable... none things affected like others, haven't looked upgrade it. unfortunately, cant update firmware yourself... two friends also package pretty happy it. think reviews people who've negative experiences... 
 good product. quick shipment provided vendor item exactly described. satisfied purchase 
 excellent replacement battery, fit fine price amazing. anyone needing replace old battery won't hold charge totally look getting one these!

 don't know, i've always liked high-tech loved idea bluetooth, even though tends make one look like space alien contacting mother ship blathering fool someone notices bluetooth unit ear.but i've never gotten good reception bluetooth units enough batter life. don't get started static wind noise.that's money can't better wired units. they're lightweight, comfortable, ample cord length. i've ordered several, you'd pay 3 times price bog-box electronics store. favor, even bluetooth, keep one one hand. well worth price. 
 it's perfect us don't smartphones headphone jack. sound quality excellent makes multitasking much easier. long wire put phone pocket problem. 
 purchased total 3 far.. 1st one sound seller replaced immediately.. others purchased use co-workers instead $50.00 apiece ones given verizon purchase.. stay ear work well...

 i've bought 20 things now, shared many friends & family, rave them. it's comfortable fits ear, sound quality (especially noise cancellation mic) *stellar* - driving noisy freeway person listening *never* know you're car.i tried several bluetooth headsets thoroughly unimpressed: charge them, add latency, add extra compression artifacts, audio clips you.this headset disadvantage wire, it's also 1/20th price bluetooth headset, won't give cancer. (ever since got large benign osteoma skull after, suspiciously, 6 months heavy cell phone use, i'm bit paranoid cell phone radiation).the jack smaller size (2.5 mm), unfortunate, smartphones days 3.5mm (so plug headset headphones). so, got smartphone, ended buying half dozen adapters, love headset much. 
 ony draw back product corded. could make product wireless would exceptional. love it, great sound, cofortable ear plays different ringtones callers know whos callings. 
 old style flip phone uses 2.5mm plugs. works well clipped ear use chat hands free. 
 like people owned multiple styles headsets varying degrees success them. plantronics cs50 simply best unit ever used. unit worked desktop phone answering system office. phone every day 6 hours rough day.i got tired holding phone ear office hours 50 feet away desk missing important call waiting for. device solved problems. headset unit gives call answer end control fingertips well volume mute control. gave remote ring detection allowed 300 feet away desk catch important call. would operate 8 hours desktop control stand charged headset meeting lunch.i used plantronics hl 10 handset lifter touching button headset could answer phone remotely ease. sound going ways excellent never issue unit. designs tried always clear people would complain could hear me. unit. noise cancelling mike cushioned ear piece made excellent communication comfortable wearing long hours day.the unit fast recharge time 3 hours 100 % full charge empty. headset extremely light comfortable phone transmission digitally encrypted security privacy. first tool would buy setting new office today. great! 
 clear transmission calls incoming outgoing. easy integration current phone system. would buy needed. 
 mine died needed new one. works perfect like old one. good product would recommend anyone. 
 bought son say: &#34;this great case held phone waterproof whole cold weekend trip. whole pack got wet case kept phone dry. would recommend anyone needs tough waterproof case.&#34; 
 got otterbox hold valuables pool summer. perfect size need completely waterproof crush proof. put paper inside held water dry bone. 100 pound son stand nearly 200 pounds crack. 
 durable, water tight, use backpack keep medical supplies dry, clamps hold tight solid click shut 
 one filled charging cables (both dock lightning) iphones ipads, car chargers, wall chargers everything needed power mobile devices traveling... conveniently placed easy grab we're going anywhere, knowing don't worry forgetting anything cannibalizing cables around house. keeps everything safe, secure dry. 
 ..and i'm europe, phones networks much better states. say think samsung currently best software (and used huge nokia fan). amazingly light, intuitive, great audio, looks great. recommend without reservations whatsoever. 
 pretty much worth (if sign plan get phone $250). otherwise little pricey. gain enough make feel good buying though, plan anyway remorse there. it's difficult tell picture i95 bigger - less bulky. features little better. course gps nize. 
 i've glanced reviews looked overall review phone, think it's little underrated. i've couple weeks try mine, battery life usage 3-4 days, use phone short calls 5 times day. phone doesn't squeak squeezed, construction tight (even flip screen doesn't wiggle much). saw complaints weight phone, even complaint metal battery panel. it's called quality, sometimes quality weighs little, phone makes pants fall it's hooked onto jeans, buy belt. phone employs java applications, download programs fit needs nextel, cost. also get third party sites, also ringtones, wallpaper, etc. phone uses gps, locate approximate position free, software give directions one location another free (navigational software), called telenav. quality speakers microphones phone great. speakers loud enough hear different rooms house, quiet enough barely hear them. sound crisp, even direct connect. also, answer slams nextel itself, don't listen it. problem tech support operate 24/7, customer service good service based organization i've ever worked with. phone full featured, isn't exactly pda phone, it's software capability 65k color screen make perform many functions pda. great phone, nextel services area, won't disappointed. 
 high initial cost (i got put promotion, duh), really love compact stylish phone. it's best nextel offered yet, although there's rumor camera phone coming soon. wait, wait bit longer, otherwise walkie-talkie style cellular, nextel best. delays like verizon (up 30 seconds!) sprint (10 secs). walkie-talkie actually works there's coverage. i'm happy customer. 
 say great phone nextel service great also.as review moron denver need used service open mouth make fool self.people review something clue goes show stupid people breed.i i90c,i95cl i730 730 great alarm buy clock need alarm.the screen little smaller brilliant color makes it,the sound good phones had.as service every carrier state colorado nextel best one thinking verizon push talk well sould push wait.if want best phone service best. 
 first quick confession: like t-mobile. hated (lack of) coverage bad service.that said, v300 good phone. won't rehash long feature list here. really like (after playing friend's) loud ringtones, good reception (despite lack gsm coverage brooklyn), great styling. phone made motorola per se asian partner, maybe explains &quot;girlish&quot; styling, it's still pretty cool. course, light weight good battery life make stand-out.my favorite phone still sanyo vm-4500 video camera walkie-talkie speakerphone cell phone sprint pcs... 
 recently used two plug trip. used one chile argentina worked perfectly. would recommend set. 
 look cheap work great. took trip china problems all. 
 update:the person actually using adapters (an 80 year old grandma) reported bassano italy worked find charged phone issues. octogenarian deal something, speaks volumes product!in case, using iphone overseas, issues power converters moot. plug us style plug adapter. even so, work own. plus!**********************************these little adaptors look like well made price right.i add get back!

 bought set adapters specifically trip europe. two different europe plugs, took both, worked everywhere went.i used adapters primarily denmark norway, worked great gave problems charging ipod, iphone, ipad, camera batteries, etc.note numbers plugs, numbers correspond cardboard insert let know use plugs. would better plugs information them, least numbers (which didn't see first put numbers them).i undoubtedly keep using adapters future trips, i'll keep updated.update:have also used thailand, worked great. 
 works supposed to, lightweight, compact, economical. covers nearly every plug ive ever needed asian except india. 
 it's problem charging mobile devices you're driving, since devices charged usb port, either built vehicle (newer models) usb chargers fit vehicle's power port (aka cigarette lighter). lot small electrical appliances made work ac power, devices, 12-volt in-vehicle power inverter answer. bought dedicated power adapters laptop computers, expensive usually work particular model laptop. tried sabrent 75-watt inverter subaru, worked fine providing ac usb power. used two ac-powered camera battery chargers aa battery charger:canon g10 battery charger - 14 wattsnikon d3200 battery charger - 20 wattsmaha aa battery charger - 16 wattsi also used inverter charge hp laptop using laptop. laptop uses maximum 50 watts running, well inverter's limits. using inverter ac devices, also recharged android smartphone 1a usb charging port.one caution: every vehicle's electrical system maximum rated power deliver vehicle's power port. subaru forester, owner's manual says 120 watts. trying power device devices exceed limit likely blow fuse. also note subaru sells 100-watt power inverter vehicle, costs $300, sabrent inverter small fraction amount.for anyone need ac power vehicle, sabrent inverter good option consider. inverter also available 150 watts (sabrent 150w power inverter 2.1a-1a dual usb charger 12v dc 120v ac (pw-c15u)) 300 watts (sabrent 300w power inverter 2.1a-1a dual usb charger 12v dc 120v ac (pw-c30u)).a product sample provided manufacturer review purposes. 
 i'm standing room tv blasting, 10 feet away. talking hertz reservations - tell (a) voice clearest one heard day (b) don't hear tv all. replace unit old earphone. "now voice sounds muffled", said, "and hear tv loud clear".i stories like this. walking busy noisy street - etymonic makes voice clear noise traffic wind. old earphone almost seems exaggerate background noise.i use foam ear piece comfortable stays place. don't like hard plastic ear pieces.nice. 
 far best wired wireless headset i've ever used (over dozen). comes headset, medium length cord 2.5mm plug, small large windscreen, 2.5mm-line in/ line adapter pc carry case, plus 3 different sized earplugs cleaning tool. use 4-5 hrs per day averagepros:very high quality speaker. like high quality headphones, phone good signal sounds great, you'll hear lots distortion poor signal. use blackberry 9650 femtocell - sounds good high quality landline. didn't sound good htc samsung (cdma) phones, indicative quality phone's voice circuitry.great noise cancelling microphone - windscreen on, use outdoors even strong wind (20 mph). background noise muted callers usually amazed cell.works glasses hats - unit held place friction. it's light enough works well. makes great outdoor activities.cord perfect length designed work phone belt clip pants pocket. form factor great takes little space.surprisingly, friction alone holds unit place. pretty durable (sitting dropping it)cheap - $35, performs much better jawbone/plantronics bluetooth variety without radiation risk outperforms high end corded headsets (call center sets, theboom)cons:2.5mm plug. every modern smartphone uses 3.5mm. time update.uncomfortable itchy extended (4-5 hrs) use. plugs made soft plastic need air ear hours (no discomfort then) 
 blueparrott, keep forgetting turn bluetooth on, paired something else i've wishing wired headset noise cancelling ability long while. it.on motorcycle can't hear engine, windscreen good low speeds (sans windshield - 30 mph smaller windscreen starts letting noise through. can't hear stereo blaring. would say slightly less able blueparrot - might boom doesn't quite reach corner mouth. problems noise coming right angle.it isolating insert blocks external noise (you might need earplug ear really noisy environments).a nits:they cases windscreens - tend get squished. stereo dual mono version would welcome. boom could bit longer.only negative don't include ipod/blackberry/(some)android 4 conductor 3.5mm adapter, already several. voip adapter.so maybe perfect, way beyond "handsfree" wired headsets used, isn't expensive does. 
 bought usb hubs past, failed. plugging 2 powered devices would make work.this usb hub 4 usb powered hard drives external dvd burner plugged work without problems! one best hubs found. 
 usb port sleek functional. plug play. even come power supply case power hungry peripherals. even though works fine without power supply chose use recommended manufacturer. comes lifetime warranty. cyperpower ups reliable expect little cyber wonder nothing less. 
 usb adapters knew with. enter cyberpower 7 port hub... pleased it. i'm techy, every day computer user. use hub imac works seamlessly, issues. bought another friend pleased well. like said, says little effort, works quite well technically challenged.

 use product 6 months great job, dlink used another system kept losing connection middle transfers threw away, one works.i use lots usb devices two one computer work fantastic. copy movies personal video player network hard drives never fail. ones would stop sending packets middle trasfer. 2 printers, 2 scanners, video capture, mouse, keyboard, tv, external hard drives, 2 flash card readers, docking sandisk mpeg player, docking ipod player, external game system updating firmware, wacom drawing board adobe cs3, attachments hook off. hubs always works.downside, ive learn tricks windows xp keeping track drive letters changing around, third party programs tried i'd rather use disk manager myself.you need little cable management unit small volume cables attached physically push around, cable ties electrical take easily takes care problem. 
 really like hub. acer one netbook, use hub power cd/dvd external drive, laptop cooler pad, 1tb external hard drive. cooler pad also usb ports, 4-in-1 memory card reader plugged that. everything works fine. sometimes unplug cd/dvd drive get netbook read properly. problem another hub though, think it's drive. works often hub though.this small. main picture makes look huge, it's really palm sized. took vacation, fit fine carry-on. don't need keep stand it.i also like one port front need plug usb drive. 
 use hub mac great. plugged usb port macbook pro never problem it. optionally power device included ac adapter, lights bunch green lights one brilliant blue light top green lights. blue light extremely bright size may need covered sleeping room it. plenty open slots additional devices. using device vertically stand front usb slot attach flash drive without effort. everything (at least mac) recognized ready go plugged in. would highly recommend hub - can't find anything nice price powered. 
 older computer ony 4 usb ports laptop 2 usb ports. 4 external drives printer various devices require usb, disconnect one computer plug everything works great. far small flash drives require external power idea. hope reviewer elaborate that. case well worth money. stays forever lit, thats okay. look funny 10 years lights extinguished.

 use macbook connect several items time including usb keyboard optical mouse, ipad iphone, webcam, external hard drive even light rama controller christmas lights. thing works great provides plenty power devices. haven't seen slowness webcam, ipad/iphone syncing even copying large movies external hard drive. guy works great disappointed performance. however bit disappointed design. sit corner desk need plenty room sides allow usb cables plug in. would design like tower plugs back one top another. said, current design offer added stability keep hub falling over. overall great performer decent design. 
 surprised find excellent powered usb hub much less money paid identicel one three years ago. somehow, misplaced power adapter ordered one mainly could get power adapter. older hub still works fine use adapter run usb 3.0 hard drives tv android mini-pc. grandson wanted hub playstation 3 slim, sees lot use. uses video gaming multi-media center. accidently damaged one two usb ports limited one usb port.i gave hub. happy friends want one!

 headset sounds excellent. earbuds aggravate ears in... even long lengths time. would definitely recommend these. 
 update: i've asked hold sweat (see below). problem working sweat treadmill, must stress i've put summer run. also must say expect longevity non-sweatoroof product, s11 headphones designed sweatproof nano coating. however, since asked, still sound work excellent. bounce around running, it's intolerable... ideal. battery: i've used every day since got them, often times days house studying day going gym. last morning night constantly connected. often forget i'm wearing turn music don't hear sound phone/tablet.edit: record, motorola site says working (under questions product, says sweatproof kept away moisture). i'm going work anyway i'll report back fail.=============================================================i bought jaybird bluebuds x girlfriend, i've used several times, comparison point.these headphones utilitarian, price conscious design. don't sound awesome $180 bluebuds, aren't sleek (bluebuds cord tiny ear pieces). but, easy control, light, sound good. i'm taking away anything saying don't sound good bluebuds... bluebuds sound good bose klipsch wired models similar cost (even mkbhd says amazing). motorola buds really sound great. i'd choose based sound cheaper wired sets (skull candy, jvc, etc.)the ear pieces, first, worried them. didn't look like would secure, wrong. easily work stay in. swivel bit ear pieces, every time move, don't hear bunch thumping like many in-ear wired sets.and taking hear world around nice, magnets. flopping around.the built-in equalizer settings nice, controls easy, stay around neck laying back.so sacrifice portability bluebuds, get great ease use, good sound, less half price.and truthfully, aren't super stylish... people walking around giant beats studio headphones on. look way less ridiculous that, really aren't bad. don't wear job interview. 
 walk away father next leading one doesn't fade even thru thickest walls 
 ear buds wonderful. let's listen privately anything need still participate daily activities. would highly recommend. 
 comfortable, clear volume great fittting around neck. don't turn aroundyour neck much lg. great 
 lg hbs-730 use bike rides problem. recently, route took lot interference near power lines tower. music lg glitches much can't enjoy music anymore. also plantronics backbeat go 2. one little bit better, music still glitches break area interference. phone samsung galaxy s4 active it's stored bike jersey back pocket, less two feet headset.before try unit, went try lg hbs-750 (one user review said less interference). hbs-750 worst. started break even enter interference area.i finally give one try. wow, don't know kind power use, three rides far haven't experience one single glitch yet. music break up, phone call conversation break up. it's nice finally uninterrupted music.i problem time, receive phone call party side couldn't hear me. don't know it's party headset. party calls back time, press pickup button, headset doesn't respond button push.the sound awesome well. say bass better hbs-730. magnet stronger well. like tuck unit behind shirt using ear plug let dangles, naturally falls attached back magnet unit ... shirt. keep earplug swinging back forth using it. don't know design accident. either way, it's cool. 
 spoiler alert: stupidly long review. like provide much detail possible write review, that&#8217;s sort thing look reviews. buying things online retailers great all, prevents us getting hands-on information we&#8217;ve already shelled money. detailed reviews best way combat disappointment buyers&#8217; remorse. either get popcorn and/or coffee, skip end, skip review entirely &#61514; seriously though, it&#8217;s long review. prepare yourself.this headset close ideal i'm probably ever going get, least headsets implanted subdermally behind ear, music communications beamed directly brain something. great sound, features, fit, looks. downsides i'll get way first, get back gushing thing. first, feel earbud cords maybe .5 .75 inches short. wear mainly i&#8217;m work, underneath collar polo shirt. cords therefor dip edge collar, make trip back ears. it's fine i'm looking straight ahead, turn head much tug 'outside' ear (if look left, tugs right ear vice versa). i've gotten around somewhat removing little silicone o-rings intended manage earbud cords. releases little cord length tugging less noticeable, still there. cords bit short taste even wearing t-shirt, aren&#8217;t bad. next downside headset support connection two devices once. get &#8220;one device time&#8221; thing improves handoff music calls, since easier services provided one phone/device, still wish could listen personal phone's music collection able take calls work phone. headsets like sony mw600 handle ease. clarify buds paired multiple devices, connected one device time. currently, i&#8217;ve got paired android tablet phone, ipod, work iphone. switch one another manually disconnecting one connecting another (via device&#8217;s settings), don&#8217;t go pairing process every time want switch &#8211; pairing buds difficult all, would get annoying real quick.now i've got way, talk stuff like buds, pretty much everything. first off, let assure headset support apt-x bluetooth connections available. apt-x bluetooth audio codec designed provide sound quality equal wired headset. bluetooth audio connections compress audio, making sound somewhat muddled and, well, bad. happens regardless quality source audio file. apt-x support commonly available recent samsung (including galaxy s3, s4, s5) htc phones (including one m8), others well. you&#8217;re interested, ridiculously complete .xlsx spreadsheet available jessebandersen dot com, simple google search also yield results. found jesse&#8217;s page searching &#8220;aptx enabled devices&#8221; &#8211; first result list. sadly apt-x supported apple yet, knowing they'll come proprietary alternative works headsets (they bought beats dre last week so, get ready). almost passed buds apt-x isn't listed anywhere specs reviews saw amazon. go motorola's site look user manual find it. originally going go lg tone headset line (which also supports apt-x), didn't like &#34;flat loop&#34; design &#8211; looks like great fit&#8230; robot. opinion buds designed better fit actual human: front control stalks bend gently down, following curve neck/shoulders/collarbones. majority headset (including small weight battery pack) rests base neck, control stalks rest comfortably near collarbones. lg tone can't time since formed flat circle: stalks aren&#8217;t angled relative neck band, carry weight battery they&#8217;ll fall collarbones center section halfway back neck (the newer ones curved like buds, $70 expensive). i&#8217;m wearing buds headset right now, hardly feel &#8211; great improvement traditional &#8220;earhugger&#8221; bluetooth headsets. i&#8217;m talking fit, probably mention wear 17.5&#8221; collar, can&#8217;t stand things touching neck throat. buds fit quite comfortably, provide slightest reassuring touch front sides neck. widest gap left right control stalks measures hair 5 inches.the buds tidy control arrangement easy navigate. play/pause/answer/end/track-skip commands (as well eq settings voice dial activation) handled rocker switch left, volume adjustments handled rocker switch right. microphone underneath rocker switch left, power switch underneath body (center section) headset, next charging port. play/pause/answer/end done single press forward half left rocker switch, little bit texture identification/grip purposes. activate voice dialing (like siri samsung&#8217;s s-voice google voice search) long-pressing button music playing. track-skip forward done single press back half switch, track-skip back done double press. kind wish skip forward/back handled separate buttons, it&#8217;s easy enough get used to. one thing note mic stalk answer/end button: feel around end call button, person end going hear since microphone right beneath it. lots loud rustling noises. oops. enough list full-on downside, still... kind annoying. could placed mic right, come think whole lot less &#8220;busy&#8221; since mostly volume control functions. volume achieved pressing forward half right rocker switch, volume pressing back half. mute active phonecall pressing portions volume rocker, reject incoming call long-pressing either one volume buttons. eq modes changed long-press &#8220;play/pause&#8221; switch left. 3 eq modes, indication one in, documentation effects supposed be. voice notification &#8220;eq mode changed!&#8221; that&#8217;s it. you&#8217;re figure exactly means. best guess modes flat, treble boost, bass boost. general &#8220;audiophile&#8221; rule, flat eq response best since doesn&#8217;t meddle sound balance hear artist intended. barely tell eq mode bass boost, can&#8217;t tell difference two. can&#8217;t tell difference, guess doesn&#8217;t really matter. i&#8217;d recommend switching modes listening general type music, getting eq setting like, never changing again. obvious pictures literature, earbuds held magnetically ends control stalks use. magnets pretty strong, earbuds yet bounce loose. fact, strong remove earbud ear don&#8217;t attach end stalk, i&#8217;ll eventually find connected point i&#8217;ve moving around. needless say, don&#8217;t get parts close credit cards.as far sound quality goes, i&#8217;m really impressed. earbuds said &#8220;premium hd speakers&#8221;, whatever truly means, sound great apt-x support really helps shine. point buds still sound great non-apt-x devices like apple gadgets, certainly sound good bluetooth headsets don&#8217;t support it. long earbuds seated properly (which critical in-ear earbuds) bass response nice solid, everything sort sparkles. saying &#8220;sparkle&#8221; added way, music fine detail you&#8217;ll hear lot it. speaking earbuds seated properly, documentation talks bit &#8220;micro-adjustability&#8221;, translates stem earbud pivot certain amount around central axis sort narrow cone shape, angle stem relative earbud&#8217;s body change bit fit different peoples&#8217; ear structures. earbuds seem stay fairly well seated unless get really sweaty. speaking sweat, also note buds labelled &#8220;sweat proof&#8221;, make worry little bit. sweat easily, lot biking walking, work somewhat physical too. hopefully become issue. little rubber plug partially remove access charging port, make sure place back securely getting sweaty. anyways, back audio quality: one important thing note, true high quality sound delivery devices, final output depends highly good source material. know low quality sources like 128kbps .mp3 files even tracks pandora streaming services aren&#8217;t best, hear every little bit badness. headsets may mask they&#8217;re also masking fine detail better quality files, way it&#8217;s actually good thing. call quality ends line really good well, i&#8217;ve never anyone ask &#8220;are using bluetooth?&#8221; usually get use headsets. fact, one person stop mid-conversation ask &#8220;didn&#8217;t say going put bluetooth headset?&#8221;, almost didn&#8217;t believe said already had. one last thing audio quality &#8211; listen music via app preamp gain, may want reduce gain level zero. use poweramp galaxy s4 dismayed first hear ton distortion, especially low end. almost returned headset could get rid it. eventually found preamp gain (on poweramp&#8217;s eq settings page) set 75% capacity, turning eliminated distortion completely. get rid distortion 25%, risk it? keep zero sure. also reduced overall volume, since things get plenty loud own, don&#8217;t mind all.usually hate looks bluetooth headsets: obnoxious blinking blue lights giant blobs techno-crud clamped peoples&#8217; ears make look like extras bad 80&#8217;s sci-fi movies. say motorola buds practically disappear, especially wearing collar polo shirt. indicator light, nestled power switch charging port, it&#8217;s visible they&#8217;re worn. say, first wasn&#8217;t pleased fact even black headset white bits (the undersides flat cords, silicone ear pieces, forward/inside halves earbud shells). changed mind much come enjoy subtle high-contrast design. looks nice modern without looking like it&#8217;s trying hard. said, practically disappears polo collar &#8211; see white silicone ear pieces touch white cord. you&#8217;ve got earbud inserted, white flash undersides cords help make little obvious others you&#8217;re either listening music talking phone. say &#8220;a little&#8221; people still give weird looks walk room i&#8217;m mid conversation. make universal &#8220;i&#8217;m lunatic, i&#8217;m phone&#8221; gesture folks, observant ones figure easily. see come blue, makes even sad don&#8217;t come red. see, sickness. sickness yet defined (or even acknowledged) science, overwhelming love (some, like wife, would say &#8220;unhealthy obsession&#8221;) black things red trim, red things black trim, or&#8230; well, get idea. came red, i&#8217;d sell 4 5 pints blood (or least black/white buds) get set. maybe one day.those main points wanted talk about. things don&#8217;t really fit review elsewhere, i&#8217;ll stick here. specs say wireless range 150 feet, &#8220;class 1 bluetooth device&#8221;, phone probably isn&#8217;t. realistic use still around 30 40 feet, minor barriers like walls doors. don&#8217;t even know find true class 1 bluetooth device, get 150ft range spec head. battery life seems pretty good, although try charge headset every night, i&#8217;ve gone far 2 full workdays mixed usage without running battery. they&#8217;re rated &#8220;up 12 hours&#8221; playback, it&#8217;s anyone&#8217;s guess actually means. talked silicone earpieces earlier, forgot mention come 3 sizes &#8211; small, medium, large. buds come small ones installed already, found mediums best me. earpieces earbuds (both wired wireless) 99% interchangeable, slightly different. posts ear stems slightly smaller diameter standard, earpieces sets bit loose. swapping earpieces buds would result sound leakage result poorer sound quality bass response, also put much higher risk one earpieces coming stem sticking ear. trust me, don&#8217;t want that. stick 3 sizes provided find one best suits you. use biggest size stand, good seal critical good sound quality. another thing mentioned briefly buds&#8217; voice notifications. buds set pre-programmed voice notifications built you&#8217;ll hear turn headset off, change eq settings, maybe commands. power up, headset plays short musical tune chipper female voice says &#8220;welcome motorola buds!&#8221; connect phone mp3 player, voice says &#8220;device 1 connected!&#8221; voice isn&#8217;t bad, took get used to. receive phone call, play another tune instead mirroring phone&#8217;s ringtone. think it&#8217;s riff first notes &#8220;ride valkyries&#8221; could wrong. buds also play soft &#8220;bloop&#8221; noise every time play pause adjust volume. &#8220;bloop&#8221; noises, really indication whether unit even powered up. mention headset loses connection automatically power 5 minutes save battery. pick headset don&#8217;t know power state it&#8217;s in, hit volume button listen bloop. headset yet drop bluetooth connection own, first headsets i&#8217;ve owned kind impressive. last thing wanted talk (yeah, made list) thin rubber strips run undersides control stalk, think serve purpose covering track wires run through. small section one strips popped week would seat back down. eventually decided probably held place sort adhesive, since could get &#8220;pop back in&#8221;, placed tiniest dab krazy glue there, wiped excess, held place dried. month ago, popped back yet.so that&#8217;s absolutely every observation motorola buds i&#8217;ve made since got them. you&#8217;ve read that, salute you. probably owe 20 minutes life back. sorry that. summary, promised start:for tl;dr crowd, wholly approve headset. it&#8217;s headset i&#8217;ve waiting quite time for, it&#8217;s finally here. features, fit, sound, looks pretty much perfect, it&#8217;s hard come list serious disadvantages. write this, it&#8217;s available $58, quite steal. nearest competitor lg hbs-800, normally goes $130. check &#8211; don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll disappointed.

 give five stars - despite technical problems:you send receive vcfs e-mail attachments - can't always file receive them. rendered well enough move material manually. varies - long filename ends .vcf mime type text/x-vcard text/directory, otherwise formatted correctly, get taken. but, applications, example, evolution, great linux e-mail application, give something never file meaningless filename, sidekick file evolution's vcards (unless export file resend right mime type).rather picking name vcard import vcard's formatting, sidekick uses filename. might mean would simply pass garbage vcf interface, careful.you get urls sms messages show urls, can't click them. can't click urls aim browser - copy text mail yourself, click urls mail, pulls makes clickable end.the documentation says phone wap browser. might say, "with regular browser, would care wap browser?" - answer bandwidth - want look phone number, wap faster. cool wap games. real answer, according t-mobile tech supervisor wap browser vaporware - work. maybe someday. sites can't browse without javascript working wap analogues (like microsoft's sms generation site). can't browse phone.that it. rest great. moved nextel data exporting data nextel site, and, openoffice, rearranged column names match would exported outlook express, imported. oh, yes, also built names formula. saved comma file, like outlook had, and, poof, minute, couple hundred phone numbers, addresses, names migrated merged appeared phone. could mailed vcfs 70-80 contacts using, didn't work.i've resisted games (i want minesweeper - yes, know lame). might drop $4 solitare.i drop $10 terminal program, already become helpful - terminal program wonderful something tiny device. check servers connecting raw mode, port. ssh, securely, server. lots disconnects, mostly related stop typing think couple minutes, program available linux called "screen" allows save programs running background reconnect them, see output, get status, stuff. even get irc using character mode irc client.someone called fix something weekend - something could fixed 5 minutes real terminal, took eight tiny terminal. many ways, emacs seems work better vi character mode, work.one secret log windows box using ssh character mode using free products cygwin sfu (from microsoft pro). command line only, sorry.to echo comments aim client, utterly reliable vs. yahoo client, drops reconnects time, probably worthwhile.the documentation suggests surf graphics speed. many buttons graphical and, unlike every character graphics browser simply displays alt text, or, none, "[image]", button completely goes away, means can't access button points to. essentially means leave graphics surf.occasionally, web sites mis-represented - ebay, example, extra entry bubble generated search text bubble putton push - enter text (which seems right place) searches don't work.despite niggling problems, t-mobile's hapless tech support, still giving device five stars. astounding thing poker playing dog wags tail good hand, tell good hand all.the difference getting text directions able pull map area drive road wonderful - javascript stops able pull turn turn map need it.i expect something hand would allow log system using ssh, browse all, much less pull mapquest maps. 
 used lot screen protectors iphone, one best. i'm happy finally clear screen cover works. past two years wouldn't even try them, using anti-glare covers. would get tired anti-glare covers opinion detracted attractiveness screen.this cover looks great; look real close even realize cover (wasn't case previous clear covers used). boxwave sent cleaning supplies two covers - made easy apply without getting dust caught between. finally, finger prints show readily cover.nice screen cover. highly recommended.

 i'm lover gadgets always get "coolest" cell phone time. phone really great past 14+ months i've owned (i blue version). i've one problem anything shouldn't (i.e. randomly powering off, antenna problems, etc). cannot say every cell phone i've ever owned. lg makes great cell phone within different models, think one best i've seen far. brother exact model loves it, too.the phone beautiful color screen, easy navigate menus, nice camera video function, outstanding battery life. complaint echo would nice times speakerphone. that, cell phone best i've found - including several lg models friends family own. 
 3 years working great. battery lasts long. phone durable solid. 
 ok, used motorola t720 (one worst phones made), motorola timeport 8767 (one best phones ever made). needed new phone ventured local verizon wireless store. happen upon lg vx7000 think...this thing huge! don't need camera phone...but pick play around it. it's pretty comfortable hold. screen nice, bright clear. wind purchasing one vzw online phone arrives, put test.this phone far terrific! phone tad larger last t720 much...the main lcd nice bright tft screen. included wallpapers, 3 "real" pics(a sunset scene, island scene, group people scene), verizon logo wallpaper "doodle type" cartoony pics. change settings display easily, ui lg much better old moto. front lcd nice enough...you also set wallpaper use pic taken camera use picture id person calls.ringtones...kinda forgettable (i beginning think cell phone providers tell phone makers make pretty useless ringers download decent ones). however, record sound surprisingly good internal mic, well download verizon's get brew service. also, use mp3's ringtones little trick. one think like...this phone loud!! hear ringing crowded shopping mall even. vibrate feature works well enough activated quickly (though requires flip open phone).the camera located "hinge" flip would rotates snap pic without contorting face arms face lens. also change pic settings like black white sepia tones, etc. camera quite decent vga cell phone camera. flash though rather useless except close pics. camera also lets take 15 sec video clips save email friends. figured i'd never use feature, twice already. advantages camera/video something always carry quite nice...it's fine candid moments though friends might know camera phone, won't probably guess you're video recording them. :dthe call quality nice,loud, clear...much better old cell phone. battery life approx. 5 days light usage charges little 2 hrs. mind you, old "blue versions" phone charging plug near data port...the new "black face" ones charge straight data port.the holster came mine (the black vx7000) great...solid cheapy like phones are. notice face phone flashes colored led's near "flash" receieve call making one...some like don't.i like phone it's size deceptive. tonight showed friend said, "that thing huge!"..then compared panasonic camera phone noticed...hers bigger lol. one verizon's best cell phones right now...highly recommended. 
 guys,i used several friends bluetooth headsets (motorolas jabras) decided didn't want one. found mobile freedom read reviews. know logitech used lot stuff good results tried it. everything read!! it's quiet wind, it's battery lasts days me, it's easy use, easy pair sound quality awesome!! nobody could ever tell using headset. takes bit get used ear clip, problems. may bit heavier larger some, little tiny ones look chic also terrible reviews terrible performance!! try out, won't regret it. 
 bought logitech reading numerous reviews various brands. use device motorola v551 phone (cingular). works geat! charges quickly charger folds compact fashion use (the electrical prongs fold recess charger). unit holds charge long time. left drawer month, pulled still ready go!i use device couple times month business, driving, etc. windscreen outstanding cuts noise even driving window open. people complain ear piece. seems fine adjust easily, keep mind headset annoyance first wear one. becomes second nature.the sound great, phone detects device quickly, fairly comfortable. performs like device twice price, 
 motorola razr phone absolutely hate low hearing volume bad reception resulting missed calls. seriously planning returning/selling got freedom headset!it makes huge difference! lightweight comfortable! problems range battery life. little bulky though. got day must buy, especially $40 $10 rebate = $30!! 
 bluetooth headset i've used, don't anything compare with. made ipaq 6315 much usable phone. sound quality good, people say sound far away, i'm experimenting gain ipaq, we'll see helps. little tight first (big ears), able bend part goes around ear little much better now. great battery life.would nice external ringer it, could hear ringing vibrate away phone. good range 15-30'. 
 let say things:buy device. reasons:- 7-8 hours talk time- true 30 feet range- wind filter clear talking- small comfortable, doesn't intrude ear- crazy price, huge quality- warranty reliability logitech!i've used sony ericsson jabra bt200 would say jabra much better sony ericsson, logitech blows away. it's faster put logitech range much better. microphone clear crisp speaker volume loud sufficient.for me, used jabra a210 bluetooth adapter sprint sanyo 8100 phone w/2.5mm headset jack. gave bt phone could use headset. auto-answer hang depends phone whether would normally headset not. works great me!if considering headset, get one. it's bluetooth technology like. it's great amazon sold out... nice. $39.99 (where go???) 
 bit skeptical saw price read reviews thought hey logitech must good. right headset comfortable compared another headset bought. ear speaker loud even point don't highest setting. mic thing worried though, called friend's cell phone talked pleasantly surprised sound volume clarity. also haven't complaints friends i've talked headset. experience logitech makes best wireless devices buck didn't let one (second logitech wireless devices two month; also bought xbox controller definitely also worth buy.) 
 cheap excellent value. problem uselessness confronted windy conditions- much better job most. v simple instructinos, though lacks ability switch easily headset & phone & back.nevertheless $35 under, brilliant value. 
 spent lot time phone, particular bt headsets. tried every brand bt headset imagine, mean every brand. frustrated point ready go back wired headset ran little guy. far best one, hands down. miserable experence jabra motorola. lot connection audio quality issues brands.bt headset designers seem favor visual appeal rather performance. don't understand headsets market short stubby, microphone right next ear instead month. microphone far away results turn microphone sensitivity, cause headset pick everything including background noise. lack effective noise-filtering system one logitech headset, end wind noise, car noise, ac noise, every kind noise voice. additional, close promixity speak microphone creates feedback loop nice serving constant echoing. lost count occasions friends coworkers end phone tell "get crappy jabra bt headset" "take motorola bt headset". amazed people end easily tell it's jabra bt headset horrid sound quality.onto gem, sound quality amazing, far best bunch. windstop system really work. together farther extending microphone, unit produce best sound incoming outgoing. know many users complaining fit, it's really fault user. one reviewer pointed out, "correct" way wear this, think provides excellent fit comfort.i can't speak all, personally don't wear bt headset fashion statement. use mean convenience safety, sound quality fit top factors consideration. note, clear winner. wish product managers designers motorola particularly jabra take note that. jabra (250 250v models) worst it's behind ear design heavy-trigger button really lousy product terms usability sound quality. sure customers raved jabra would rank unit world!

 could impressed. highly skeptical buying bluetooth headsets like crazy trying find one worked, they're pretty much junk. thing worked way sidewalk, likely much further, that's far went. quality end clear. manual plain stupid, looks like half way putting together released it, mac manual course needed, plug worked without driver install nonsense windows requires. btw, using primarily skype.ok, add something review. there's fatal flaw device. flaw makes device near worthless now. usb cable unplugged, earpiece left clipped holder/charger, battery runs within hours. obviously simple diode somewhere would prevented this, device close useless.update: may 8th 2011. so, 5 years later, device seriously failing. electronics device dying. constantly remove battery get headset work, it's cutting middle calls. also refuses charge, discharges use even base connected via usb. it's pity failing, came looking new version, none. buy again? 
 usb wireless headset. plug mac pc sees another sound device , drivers needed (xp os x) tested skype mac teamspeak pc . comes sound api windows skype others allow buttons phone pickup hangup calls , try like use apps without special add ons ...the range great , skype dont want tied pc plug bad boy free walk house , goes teamspeak gamers there.it pleasing something work box change! tried hours thing using bluetooth mess... thing works! 
 use product skype calls. found high quality (but expensive) wireless headset voip uses. use windows vista windows 7. headset lasts long time (all day) without charging, go computer outside house half way street still clear calls. ear piece comfortable i'd like, wear think head adjusts shape.software install easy, setup pretty no-brainer. functionality adjustments use learn about.i use brand also regular phone headset work phone absolutely love it. i've found high quality calls battery life every plantronics device i've ever used. 
 got treo 650 pre-order day using treo 600 year (and 4 replacements ... 600s kept breaking). dramatic improvement love it.the screen high res looks incredibly clear, bluetooth works wonderfully wireless jabra headset. call comes simply hit answer phone call comes headset. don't particularly like comfort fit jabra ear probably looking alternatives well.the camera actually good enough take snapshots would keep. almost good low end digital cameras. critical buttons placed intuitively.initial setup went pretty smoothly, far, seamlessly upgraded old treo 600 software imported contacts calendar well almost applications. sprint phone rep activated phone actually seemed quite knowledgable.the real con treo 650 hotsync cable connector big clunky compared 600. imho made backward step replacing sleek original treo connector tungsten design connector. requires separate power supply charge. used charging treo 600 single usb hotsync cable laptop. extra power connection messy annoyance. upside since battery removable spare charging elsewhere.overall opinion wouldn't even consider returning buying treo 600 treo 650 available. 
 purchased phone months ago truly say one best investments ever made! doubts comfortable i'd lugging around big phone like this, short lived hands. get much use phone, phone itself, pda capabilites. never organized top things. thing sometimes freezes connects bluetooth, it's minor complaint one easily overlooked look back see much phone helped me.

 nextel user years motorola products including i90, i95, i730 i830. v3 best motorola product ever!!! blows i830 water makes look like yesterdays news. superior striking good looks solidly built - no, look cheap previous reviewer stated. live ga cingular reception good. paired v3 bluetrek g2 bluetooth headset(received rave reviews cheap - pick one ebay) wonder took long get board. fear cingular's merger at&t; since at&t; years ago reception terrible.i'll never go back nextel appreciate customers motorola products bluetooth except blackberry. plus wants carry around brick pocket? i'm woman typically carry v3 purse sometimes convenience want put jean pocket. forget it's there...this v3 superior browser technology, email text messaging, good camera great voice record. yes, address book different get used it. anyways, put important people call frequently address book it's problem me. primarily make lots calls like check news send text messages. a+++++++ 
 sexy form... check. innovative construction... check. exclusive price tag... check. sea flip phones candy bar phones look alike, razr v3 ferrari mobile phones stands such. you're looking feature rich phone, v3 v600 provide features far less. want high-quality constructed phone screams, &#34;look me, i'm sexy b*tch,&#34; v3 alley.actually, better analogy would be: acura nsx mobile phones. like nsx, feel v3 marketing tool motorola. it's way saying, &#34;we're known inexpensive phones, but, look, build stylish, well-crafted, high-end phones too!&#34;unless wireless technology improves gsm, v3 phone definitely keep 2 years. styling, design, construction good (i upgraded trusty reliable, yet mediocre nokia 3360 tdma phone).there's quite debate construction v3 best explanation i've heard bottom backside (below battery cover) lower front plastic antenna. certainly makes perfect sense (unless metal frame antenna) areas cold touch (in weather) areas usually room temperature. furthermore, would misrepresentation motorola's part advertise such. regardless, phone may seem flimsy, it's solid -- comparison w/ old nokia 3360 girlfriend's v551.mikey's likeys:1- mini-usb port. great single-point access data charging -- it's simple mobile phone standard!2- bluetooth connectivity. coming wired hands-free setup, bluetooth headset (a jabra bt250) godsend. leave v3 charging home office still connected living room. (side note: stay away d-link bluetooth usb adapter pc connectivity get belkin f8t001 adapter -- read review d-link details)3- quad band. doubtful i'll ever use feature/benefit, two words certainly impress around you.4- speakerphone. i've non-believer mobile phone speakerphones, i've got admit, v3's speaker phone bomb. it's loud clear (but loud enough car). girlfriend tells sound better w/ v3 speakerphone w/ old nokia 3360 wired headset setup. don't bluetooth headset, i'm spoiled w/ speakerphone.5- internal display. going v3 nokia 3360 leap spacial proportions couple weeks, found spoiled w/ large internal display. that, v3 ati imageon graphics accelerator! phones (excluding pda phones) pale comparison regard.mikey's no-likeys:1- memory expansion. don't see using 5mb internal memory, sd/mmc card expansion slot would nice. maybe motorola (or somebody else -- maybe myself) come w/ mini-usb adapter purpose.2- poorly written owner's manual. found owner's manual like reference manual sometimes leaves figuring things own. explain use many common features owners (especially ones new motorola phones) use. instead, lists features expects put 1 1 together. it's like &#34;c++ reference&#34; vs &#34;learn program c++ 21 days.&#34; maybe motorola's technical writers technical?3- drops dings. like &#34;ferrari,&#34; i'll probably go week-long mourning first time drop ding phone. i'm hoping [good] cases available protect v3 juggles around w/ keys pocket. (side note: heard cingular / lockline insuring phone, cingular sales guy hesitant sell phone unless bought insurance)4- edge. girlfriend's $99 motorola v551 edge. shame, shame, shame motorola. bad motorola. bad, bad, bad. alas, it's akin buying $160k ferrari 360 modena cheap $20 factory stereo system (or paying $90k acura nsx it's 290hp).5- internal display colors. hyped hear 260k colors, motorola's specs detective footwork 65k colors, 260k colors mpeg-4 video playback. very, very, sneaky mis-leading indeed.wishlist:1- wished pocketpc smart phone version phone. pocketpc + v3 form factor = perfection.regarding multiple numbers one name review -- set phonebook display primary numbers by:1- setting primary number names multiple numbers (you don't name one number);2- set address book view &#34;primary contacts&#34; phonebook menu &#62;&#62;&#62; phonebook setup &#62;&#62;&#62; view;3- voila, primary numbers displayed.the way motorola implemented intuitive nokia's implementation (refer owner's manual dis-like above), found motorola's implementation little robust.update: it's nearly three weeks since i've bought phone buyer's remorse. 
 i've phone here's think.the user interface bad rap people, yes, it's intuitive say, nokia's interface, pros. customize every button, including 4 arrows, left right soft keys. left soft key programmed go "shortcuts" every function need right there. course, use, get used interface.the volume phone decent. problems hearing people, problems hearing me. speakerphone works great too. boyfriend says longers feels like he's talking someone tunnel use speakerphone calls. volume problem see highest volume (7), still slightly hard hear phone ring. one thing - phone way cool ringtones.the address book issue this: use sim card store addresses, no, able multiple entries one person. use phone's memory store numbers, many many numbers stored entry. numbers stored powerbook's address book, i'm worried sim card. mac, isync works wonders syncing numbers/calendars razr....now that's cool!the screen large clear. problems seeing dark even bright light. problems reception cingular far. fact, stronger signal places previous phone (nokia 6230)overall, pleased design, functions, asthetics phone.

 bought phone editors choice leading computer magazine. would preferred motorola v3 razor still far expensive found phone basically razor thin stylish.plus points phone include:- beautiful screen. large, bright, excellent resolution.- good pictures camera. can't believe .3 megapixels... course won't able blow posters anything like viewing computer even occasional 3x5 print pictures good.- excellent sound quality speaker ringtones speakerphone sound great.- nice construction easy grip rubberized metal trim back.- button layout nice dedicated button taking pictures volume buttons side. also note buttons user programable.- phone also voice dialing picture caller id (although pictures small appear external display)- bluetooth easy set use- true quad band phone used worldwide (although unlocked first).- excellent battery life. can't believe reviews say needs charged every day... find charging phone 4-5 days moderate use. course screen saver turned make sure bluetooth disabled using maybe great stanby talk times. also place purchased phone told charge 24 hours first use (to condition li battery) maybe helped increase battery life.the negative points phone include:- blue external display looks cool think would visible typical backlit black white lcd (like motorola v180)- instruction manual (like motorola manuals) good job explaining features play phone little bit fully make use phone do.- even though pictures camera excellent, video quality good. course cell phone video camera guess would expect. also flash camera (unlike camera phones) low light pictures great.- usb port phone unless want buy motorola cable, way transfer pictures computer (and mp3's phone) via bluetooth. (hint: get bluetooth adapter less $20 bucks don't waste money buying motorola cable. also bluetooth adapter won't need special software transfer pictures mp3... use software bluetooth adapter).- connector charger typical motorola design occasionally jiggle get fit right make sure press button connector removing else damage contacts... may users problems charging phones- phone comes blue look cool motorola phones like v180 razorall best phone owned. user's complain call drops bad signals complaining carrier phone. personally noticed ever since cingular at&t; merger, signal quality call quality declined. cingular rep told temporary able better integrate networks... makes sense problem since switched sim card new cingular sim makes use networks. 
 i've phone four months now, haven't single technical problem mine, even couple typical drops paved surfaces. charge every night; however, i've found bluetooth radio makes significant difference battery life, may spur complaints shorter battery life v400 (no bt capability one). possible turn bt radio don't need accessories connections. charge lasts several days this. really don't feel inconvenienced charging daily leaving bt on, though.in general, phone great screen quality (compared directly friends' v400s), great speakerphone polyphonic ringtone capability, great sound quality ends, great voice dialing performance (very useful headset), i'm entirely satisfied camera, considering cellphone camera.i'll admit interface bit cumbersome first, it's customizable changeable function keys, shortcuts, menu orders. find mine efficient since i've tweaked suit tastes usage.additionally, contrary previous reviews, successfully transferred information (phone book, etc.) media (pictures, ringtones, etc.) phone bluetooth adapter pc, without using cingular's services. trouble getting work initially, found firewall getting way (remember, bluetooth network connection).i suppose one complaint conspicuous absence games (only comes bejeweled demo), end doesn't really bother me. could buy game $4 really wanted one.overall, find phone feature-rich high quality, efficient use customized, rugged average cellphone. 
 owned one three months, started fall apart. $30 best buy. haven't replaced it, $30 *lot*.$10? i'm buying two more. moving 20 mph bicycle, talking someone, problems. far better sound quality 'backup', jabra boom. ear volume adjustable phone, i'm wondering phones reviewers won't let adjust volume?

 pleased first cover ordered samsung galaxy note 2, wife loving one boxwave. loves compartments id, credit card, money. fit good, problems taking pictures talking. likes carrying strap well, case's flexibility. 
 great case note 2. undecided whether use cover belt holster i've always used. wound ordering both, reiko case. work good separately, together. try use both, almost impossible remove note 2 reiko becomes stuck due tight fit. decided use boxwave exclusively dissatisified decision. simply slide note 2 front pocket. no, phone isn't big pants pocket.the pros case makes note 2 look stylish, due rubbery feel, makes phone feel quite stable hand; however, rubbery feel doesn't interfere going pocket. come con boxwave tuxedo suitup case, would due glossiness, shows fingerprints, however, wipe easily.in summary, would definitely order one cases again. 
 received item dec. using since then. wanted make sure liked job. light weight add bulk phone protecting it. well worth money. thinking ordering different colors. :-) 
 favorite tpu case. offers enough protection grip, take easily slip right back on. slip couple cards bills phone case need be.

 bought many cases many different cellphones first case compelled write review. far, best case ever had. fits perfectly, you'd think meant second skin phone. fact doesn't add lot bulk, feels like protect well makes much better. case worth double triple price. wish made exact case every phone. would go-to case. please make one htc one! 
 first, i'm huge fan tpu cases; hate silicone ones. there's huge difference, case you, reader, doesn't know. tpu better... light years better!but lot not-so-good tpu cases there; there's anything wrong tpu. rather, it's they're cheaply made, cut precisely accurately... sort thing.this particular case epitome precision cut. it's perfect. every hole centered whatever reveals beneath... camera lens, flash, speaker, mic holes, earphone jack, and, course, stylus. note there's holes power button volume rocker......and that, trust me, way be! many tpu cases make cutouts power button volume rockers, that's huge mistake. you've ever cleaned old-style computer mouse -- know, ones hard rubber ball partially hanging centerhold bottom -- you've ever open one cleaned one, you've seen dark kinda' fuzzy weird stuff must scratch rollers whatnot. stuff body oil, mixed skin cells, mixed dust hair, mixed lint mouse pad, mixed godknows else. gets around virtually anything humans touch......including inside around hardware buttons smartphone! stuff gets there, buttons stick, phones either won't turn off, can't screens awakened properly... or, one common ones people often don't realize caused sticking power button: boot loops!having tpu cover covers power button volume rocker helps eliminate problem. course, there's still electromechanical home key that's uncovered; look youtube find examples phones owners mistakenly believe broken, home keys cause weird behavior; but, fact, that's wrong time home key gotten gunked-up aforementioned body oil, mixed dust hair, mixed with... well... get picture.there's lot home key problem (if it's hardware electromechanical one, opposed simple capacitive glass), sure keep crap power buttons volume rockers tpu cases cover them......and one does... magnificently. even nicely-molded buttons (as opposed cheap tpu cases sort bulge little bit texture added it. case simply molded beautifully!this case special another reason, too, many people, i'll bet, don't know about, that's precisely sides wrap onto front face phone: bezel around glass screen. it's really nice, different tpu cases it.remember note ii kinda' unique very, edges glass screen aren't like almost phone. phones perfectly flat piece glass screens; there's metal bezel case almost comes contact glass's edge all-'round; top bezel ever-so-slightly elevated flat plane glass screen, place phone glass screen table, glass, itself, actually touching table bezel edge holding millimeter table's surface.well, note ii's glass actually higher (when it's lying back) bezel edge case; and, fact, very, edge note ii's glass seesm roll toward case's bezel. such, lay note ii face (on glass, it's glass actually touches table. makes bit nightmarishness regard screen protectors; one maker (realook) manufactures two dry-apply versions note ii: one sits flat part note ii's screen, leaves wider-than-normal amount uncovered glass edge screen protector actual glass edge; make another (the realook "3d" screen protector note ii) that's molded actually wrap rounded edge note ii's glass, "hang" it, speak, make protector's edge come closer case's bezel, causing completely cover glass rounded edge.with tpu cases, tpu sides wrap onto face glass; totally flat screen protectors leave half millimeter screen protector edge bezel, that's fine. tpu case actually ends-up covering edge make look like screen protector covering entire glass. realook "3d" style screen protector wraps edge, kind -- common kind -- tpu case cause edges corners 3d screen protector curl pull up.this boxwave tuxedo suitup case magnificently shaped edge around glass protrudes higher plane glass, phone laid face (on glass sreen), glass doesn't touch it's held millimeter table desk. gets better: edge "respects" rounded edge note ii's glass, doesn't try wrap onto cover it. therefore, realook 3d screen protector's edges corners remain intact look beautiful.this special tpu case... different others... kind have, actually, use either wet- dry-apply screen protector whose edges go either way to, edge of, note ii's glass.seriously, thing precision... someone really took moment figure best cover unusual note ii... got perfect!the thing wish matte finish back wouldn't show fingerprints. tpu cases called "s-style" "s-series" tpu cases matte finish one side "s" shape case's back, shiny finish (like case everywhere) side "s" shape case's back. entire back boxwave tuxedo suitup kind matte finish that's "s" cases, opinion; least option get either way.sadly, "s" series style cases type whose side wrap way onto touching glass, note ii, doesn't work well screen protectors. plus, many "s" style series cases uncovered power volume rocker buttons. also leave much phone uncovered around camera flash... none problems boxwave tuxedo suitup; me, least, it's worth endure shiny, fingerprint-showing surface.great case! best-of-breed, least among cases don't cause edges corners screen protectors curl-up pull-up. one using "3d" type screen protector realook, though; one using realook's screen protector attaches flat part note ii's screen, tpu cases note ii would fine (as long cover power volume rocker buttons); thing made nicely one. seriously, one made very, well... precise. love it!gregg l. deselmsnapa, california usagregg greggdeselms dot com 
 nice, looks good & durable quality & price wise well. really works described...for samsung note 2. buy accessories online now...more way cheaper & find difference what's store expensive. 
 needs excellent price. fits well, seems rigid enough prevent damage, kickstand nice touch. don't know well kickstand hold time, works well. ridge around front allows put phone face without touching table. case pretty compact still fits smart dock, although prevents hdmi registering. charges goes dock mode, doesn't seem sit far enough engage hdmi. 
 bought daughter phone loves it. solid case easily cleaned soap water. 
 little thick protects well kickstand stronger cases i've tried.the thicker corners also make harder slide car dock. 
 boxwave case bought note ii (bodysuit) disappeared amazon. case uniform glossy texture. boxwave case note great. new case even better. thinner streamlined, buttons work even better. doesn't cutouts buttons, instead well-designed buttons molded case push phone's buttons. like buttons work well protected time crud/damage. cutouts ports/mics/camera/stylus placed perfectly sized appropriately. lastly, case made tpu, best case material opinion. it's firmer stays phone better soft silicone cases pick lint stick pocket, still offering cushion drop it. 
 fits perfect, nice clean look, going buy another one leave inside car case. 
 cover nice, looks expensive. well built, built last. recommend cover. get 
 i've bought several hard cases note2 one favorite. it's easy put take (once figure out). don't drop phone usually can't say drop covers back sides. it's one piece hard case really like. 
 i'm pleased case. one piece slips fairly easily. it's real grippy like enough grab hold onto it. goes holder pocket easy enough. stand back works great! stand closed it's flush back case lays flat. cases, stands, hinges parts sick out. blue nice true line image. really like it. price amazing! 
 always types case get pay price, buy several change something different almost weekly 
 purchased item sold directly amazon...it "genuine motorola" gets...it works perfectly...at&t; wanted $29.00..amazon wanted $8.38...beware sellers!!as items genuine ruin battery even work all!! 
 purchased charger use motorola razr. already one essentially identical, except old phone (motorola v5510 different sytle adapter razr, uses 'mini-usb'.this product inexpensive, exactly says, charges phone car using auto's power/cigarette outlet, comes cute little motorola 'm' insignia lights bloue use. low price - paid less $9 amazon - there's really reason buy non-oem charger. 
 happy service product exactly description stated! would again!

 update: 18 march 2014after case week, absolutely love it! hasn't broken, however broken nicely comfortable use. cards held securely pocket deep enough bills folded half. plus, stylish. received several compliments questions regarding get own. complaint access volume buttons restricted (i use skipping music tracks i'm driving don't turn screen on).original: 11 march 2014i've case phone couple hours, thought would give update works. put phone case, came almost immediately. solution: take back cover phone put case. holds much securely don't worry it. case seems well made thicker hoped, hopefully protect phone well. one thing worried thin plastic holds phone case. i'll give update breaks chips like many reviewers, then, great case. 
 given half price twelve south's bookbook case iphone 5, expected get cheap imitation here.i think it's fair say twelve south imitation, it's close copy iphone 4/4s bookbook style case, iphone 5 bookbook case. (the new twelve south iphone 5 bookbook case clip secure iphone 5, rather sliding phone leather holster securing tab top.) personally, loved twelve-south's bookbook case iphone 4/4s, didn't like new twelve-south bookbook case iphone 5 returned mine - looked cheaply made, extremely tight, awkward fit getting phone clip case large remnants glue coming over-sized piece plastic decided stick (rather enormous) hole cut camera. product better quality twelve south product. certainly looks feels like real leather, although suspect may (based smell). turns imitation leather, would bonus me, i'm mostly vegetarian anyway :-) price twelve south bookbook case iphone 5, would still prefer boxwave case. 
 great case samsung galaxy s3 boxwave great job making quality classy durable product. love incorporates wallet phone together instead carry separate. provides access buttons, camera, charge slots, speakers makes look obvious closed. many people often mistake journal, calendar, bible, etc. also like protects screen closed position. great product. 
 want basically eliminate issues holding device secure way maintaining total coolness it?this may looking for. seems actual leather unlike many similar cases claim leather actually plastic. wear skinny jeans tend keep phone shoved pocket, you. carry elsewhere concerned combining phone essential bits wallet, really really nice. tend travel car wind carrying phone wallet places eat. allows get three basic things wallet eliminate need carry two restaurant.it makes holding onto phone less complicated factor googol. particularly landscape.the material (seems leather) impregnated serious amount oil close lid, leaves mark face phone. simple solution get paper index card, fold red line top shove little folded bit slot behind cards. &#34;old way&#34; fall back need actually write anything )or someone write something you(, add perfect layer weightless scratch proof protection ever fragile nexus 4 screen.for less might pay 'official' bumper....no brainer. 
 case great quality nice grey color. one day long term review yet. 
 i've previously owned multitude headsets, let tell missing bought jabra.i always thought "in ear" bud bulky-looking design would uncomfortable, not. frankly comfortable headset ever worn, i've worn dozens. truly forget head.as sound quality, everything hear clear, ample volume available. people speak report equally clear sound without much, background noise.battery life great range sufficient put smartphone cradle walk around house office without signal loss crackling.something else liked belt clip. many headsets overlook fact nowhere put earpiece you're using it. belt clip small, big enough actually hold headset, tucks right behind clip phone.if you're clip-loving person, whole headset almost flat profile fits nicely pocket. headsets, especially flip-out mics feel awfully bulbous pocket.one last little "gee whiz" feature- vibro-alert. since want phone charge/sync cradle whenever possible, feature really excites me. instead required actually wear headset times avoid missing call phone room, headset vibrate feature notify incoming call. call "gee whiz" feature never knew needed it!in summary, awful lot headsets there. designs features confusing, rest assured knowing headset everything need (and things may not!) reasonable price. 
 trying motorola hs 810 would feel like always falling falling off, tried several bluetooth headsets sprint cingular stores. jabra, same, loop hook onto ear, fit.this one headset would properly wrap around ear ear piece goes ear canal, stay anchored. sound quality great. hs 810 would hold charge long. far good jabra --- holds charge motorola needed charged time.i like vibrating feature phone ringer turned --- need share noise. call expecting calls often dinner, really makes discreet rather missing call playing telephone tag awhile.sound quality better motorola hs 810. jabra seems work well small ears ear cells make adjustable.if don't need vibrating feature, try new jabra bt 500 upgrade jabra bt 250, charging usb cable great take another charger trip!i also jabra sp500 wireless speakerphone works great vs. motorola speakerphone returned. speakerphone power power ac cords bt 250v compatible, need use both, need two charges, although small. 
 best bluetooth device i've tried. lightweight, comfortable, easy set-up, good sound clarity well made sturdy device. aren't flimsy parts break.the best thing ear peace fairly inconspicuous sits ear. really don't want look like janet jackson control video walk around town mall.the problem finding replacement ear gels. available jabra site site. ended back cingular (now & t) gave couple drawer. 
 replaced 250 3 times verizon store asked given 250v instead 4th 250, far good, think jabra knew 250 defects , 250 died (stopped pairing) 2 months, 250v seems problems works much better motorola v710.the fit great, sound good, could use better noise cancellation, oh well, maybe future model. overall , like 250v. recommend anyone. roll windows driving, wont heard end call. 
 several these. also lots bluetooth headsets. times live wired headset (which time) use one. sit crowded restaurant person talking thinks alone quiet office.brilliant design every phone maker license build handsets.it two microphones, one facing mouth one facing out. cross-connected sound comes sides cancelled. sound coming mouth picked up.stays ear without loop, seals ear canal well actually turn volume.the earpiece shure e2c consumer-grade in-ear monitor (which also own). essentially getting 1/2 $100+ in-ear monitor phone. means excellent sound quality. combined best noise cancelling i've ever used, say best kept secret telephony.i use cell phone land-line phones. one ever knows kind phone i'm on.highly recommended... 
 i've unit year, acts ear plug ear i'm wearing on, hear caller even strong winds. audio quality great. since microphone sits directly front mouth caller hear fine many times don't know car. since it's wired unit, batteries charge it's always ready go. don't mind things ear great head set.update: moved i-phone palm phone. get 2.5mm adapter 3.5, phone see headset time won't route calls it. blackberry curve. hope sure make new model phones, miss using it. 
 shure's quietspot headset best headset market, period. problem shure's coyness works microphone placement *absolutely crucial* using it. understand that, understand everything need order want want anyone else's.the "problem" quietspot--mentioned reviewers here--is failure engineering quality control, one emphasis documentation. barring actual defective unit (which usually work all) nothing wrong quietspot proper adjustment doesn't totally eliminate. believe shure doesn't tell fear alienating technically unsophisticated customers. since nothing sell you, blissfully unconcerned boring write something useful. please note write basis close examination working quietspot educated layman's knowledge.observation tells that, shure's quietspot headset uses active noise cancellation cellular headset market does. means mouthpiece headset uses two microphones: one takes sound world around second takes sound mouth.using trick wiring, dual-microphone arrangement uses sound outside world uses weaken sound microphone closer mouth. since microphones take surrounding sound, strongest sound *isn't* cancelled voice.for work, microphones need good alignment mouth. quietspot demands 'mouth-side' microphone pointed directly mouth, 'world side' microphone pointed directly outwards without mis-alignments like microphone-housing far two far side mouth, microphone housing turned side.the tough part boom holds microphone twist bend quietspot pocket case, turning microphone head around onto side. microphone-head turned it's side, set far mouth, microphones pick voice equal intensity arrangement exactly it's supposed to: treats *your voice* like background-noise sends everything say oblivion.the solution easy useful: learn put quietspot's microphone right place every time put on. learn windscreen on, close perfect headset. used quietspot, standing bars new york city jukebox blasting raise voice far ordinary conversational volume quietspot's noise-blocking earpiece, could hear listener perfectly. two-way noise elimination well-adjusted quietspot amazing, providing sense intimacy privacy conversations headset ever gave including one two cost more.the thing need know quietspot particularly sensitive wind=noise unless intent never use outside, best keep windscreen permanently attached unit. needle thread foam, thin-strand wire. you've done this, you'll learn make important adjustment touch even then, it's still easy.now know this, give quietspot try. won't disappointed. 
 research years ago purchased amazon. it's best headset years. followed 2.5mm cell phones 3.5mm cell phones adapter. sadly, parties longer hear it. even tried new 2.5 3.5mm adapter luck. i'm looking new headset there's nothing like one. shure right wish still made it. everyone likes bluetooth it's hard hear heard. can't believe there's nothing like market anymore. jabra bad reviews tried plantronics one returned it. i'm mourning loss headset wish it'd magically work again. 
 drive convertible gone 6 different hands-free devices didn't work. wind noise awfully high top down, wife could never hear talked hands-free. longer problem. shure works great! comfortable, clear sounding best - i'm audible speak. "turbo" button, would perfect, - terrific. best i've seen... 
 stunned. 2 plantronics (a 320 330) tired earhooks came loose dropped calls. thought provider calls got dropped consistently areas drive to/from work. headset phenomenal! maybe one dropped call week... off/on operation great! open/close boom turn off/on! love headset... don't say often 
 animal fantastic. fool using headset wire. every time turned head ear piece would fall out. turn head still feeling thing waiting strangle me.i reluctantly went motorola hs850 bluetooth headset find life could without wire. initially charge it. phone rest me; located headset immediately started use it. set one ring tome alert answers. virtually background noise say "hello". voice comes clear loud enough use noisy areas. however tell caller hold go appropriate location foot. want accused rude talking self. car warning gives time turn radio caller detect mobile. try make care calls curt call back static location. mobile commuters get offended hand ear change lanes signaling.i keep phone belt never pull out. seldom make out-going calls however phone headset designed make voice dialing instructions still pull phone out. home leave phone book case across room headset still works well. feel like recluse fold headset turned off. 
 one better bt headsets own. hear end heard clearly other. talk time great standby time great. let wife borrow see liked it, needless say ordered another one myself. moto keeps getting better. 
 i'm bluetooth techie, can't compare headsets, month ownership, say works great.my car built-in bluetooth, everbody tells i'm car sounds like i'm water. motorola - i'm told it's crystal-clear.the negatives are:* multifunction button tactile feel - leads press hard, often. especially problem you're walking driving.* flip mic nifty, headset tends wobble shake head all. 
 siemens sx66 (yes, pda-phone supposedly works bluetooth headset there), i'm happy headset.it's reasonably comfortable, great sound volume, even noisy environments, people say sound clear even automobile driving, synchronized right away sx66.most importantly, boom mic flip, turn unit fraction second. sx66 recognizes hs850 headset within second (i'm latest bluetooth v1.1 driver siemens/microsoft - tried applying patch siemens' website, phone already latest version).in short, everything works well, ambient noise cancellation features seem work well, according people i'm talking to.i haven't run point completely lost power - don't know long lasts. least 3-4 days idle 4-5 hours talk time. 
 one lucky get one free registering motorola mpx-220. skeptical whole bluetooth scene, headset quickly changed mind.the device easily last 3-4 days standby mode average usage. sound excellent, people listen think i'm talking normal phone. range great. 50 feet away without problem.the best part phone intuitive on/off. microphone boom "folded" out, turns on. fold back in, turns off. simple, yes. many headsets require push buttons (or hold down). makes using snap!i actually one home office another leave car. 
 bought product weeks back. works really great samsung t609. bluetooth enabled phone, everything else works smooth. good voice quality. 1 small glitch - found use bluetooth, uses battery power cell phone. 
 happy headset. use motorola razr v3.my last bluetooth headset jabra, broke months -- power button quit working, always battery drained.i love hs850 since power button! instead, flip open closed. gets great battery life, since it's easy put standby flipping closed.i also used headset successfully skype windows mac. catch active one device time, disconnect/release cell phone, successfully use windows mac. makes switching back forth pc phone bit cumbersome. course, took couple hours get working windows, worked first try mac ;-) 
 imho slightly better moto h700. it's larger, bit heavier. boom larger. that's issue, equal imho. cheek problem!now problem people cannot hear you, sound muffled away phone. wearing bluetooth, look mirror see boom touches cheek beard it'll touch that. note small hole inside boom gets sound. anything touches impede voice....it's like putting towel regular phone talking someone. need puffy cheeks problem happen. unless narrow face, chances happen you'll blame bluetooth!to fix this, get either neoprene tubing sticky foam one end (mole skin) cut small piece put hinge near boom smaller piece (if needed) top other. make space cheek boom people hear you! fix, still able close boom. 
 wired motorola razr headset better bluetooth one reasons:-the mic closer mouth voice sound better clearer bluetooth headset mic way ear. tried wireless bluetooth headset voice always sounded distant callers could hear ambient room noise around me. said sounded like using speakerphone. use wired headset, say voice quite clear loud.-it's easier plug wired headset time fool around settings syncing bluetooth want headset.-this headset easier carry bluetooth one ac adapater charger battery required.-this headset cheaper bluetooth headset fact comes bundled razr phones.the reason i'm rating headset 5 stars agree reviews, earpiece doesn't fit snuggly ear. minor complaint though headset pretty much want nicely. 
 perfect slim close fitting case well worth money. razr remains thin since case wellcrafted. bulk extremely stylish. krusell makes best cell phone cases world. 
 fits motorola razr v3 like specifically designed it. elastic top allows use flip functionality phone unlike leather covers prohibit phone closing way.perfect. 
 protects phoneit doesn't really make phone thickthe multi-adapter system really works (although usually leave off)the cover snap (literally) install/remove high qualitythe motorola cover pretty bad (see reviews) 
 actually quad-band mobile phone makes true 'world phone'... common tri-band devices.world phones generally equipped w/ 1900 1800 frequencies. together, frequencies cover europe, much u.s. many countries. tri-band units, however, usually equipped either 850 900mhz.850 fills 'rural gaps' states. 900 allows roaming new zealand australia. whereas t-mobile cingular operate gsm frequencies therefore offer world phones, cingular operates 850 t-mobile 900. allow use frequencies instances don't provide needed frequency... provided device equipped w/ 850 & 900 mhz motorola v330.how t-mobile? truth matter (as mobile phone service) comes region live well building area building in. sorry, across-the-board answer. soon one gets great reception, his/her neighbor curses it.visually, phone indistinguishable another flip phone, offers rather large well-spaced keys. screen vivid bright. ringtone gets plenty loud. reasons, it's great phone seniors still want modern phone. got one mum.of course, quad-band, video, camera, multi-zoom, bluetooth, infrared device w/ browser, general ease operation easy. 'said,' many senior probably couldn't bothered w/ messing putting test call quality rural u.s. new zealand.that get price makes v330 eyebrow-raising steal.one thing - it's blue, de riguer black silver, like.a quality phone packed w/ host goodies. go 'head on, motorola. 
 one nicest phones used. traditional flip phone use phone phone works well. 
 itching treo ever since 600 came noticed streamlined design. smartphones first introduced, bucked trend combining two thinking often use cell phone pda, bought one integrated would wear twice fast. humble opinion, valid reason back then, original phone/pda's impossibly large. well finally become convert.i spent great deal time researching blackberry's vs. treo's vs. pocket pc's came close grabbing t-mobile dash (which still believe all-around smallest model availabe write this, least seemed be), finally settled trusted palm os platform (one become familiar years using pda's quite time now). set get one, really heart set treo 680...but read reviews them, one thing kept creeping almost reviews: battery life terrible. aside, quite reviewers mentioned things considered, happy old 650. saw many reviews began think twice. noticed 700p beefed version 650, began consider well. unfortunately write this, isn't available alltell service (it will, nobody give target date, dang it, impatient wait...) right back 650. took palm able knock enough bugs 650 felt like buying one would worth it...and discovering bugs associated 680 & 700p, matter much time spend considering upgrading newer model, find compelling reasons go right back old school 650.reason #1 go it: since longer available palm's official website, newer models coming out, chances find pretty sweet deals older 650.reason #2: virtually problems originally associated 650 eliminated. want push email? get it. want web surfing? prob. want view edit ms word documents excell? easier ever 650 (that one major plus pocket pc's blackberrys -- sure view documents, cannot edit them, too).reason #3: matter convenient pda, found next impossible give touch-screen's amazing versatility ease use edit things connect websites.one important item factor considering buying 650: popularity ever increasing wireless downloading speeds, afraid slower treo would make internet surfing next impossible archaic speeds forced endure. pleastantly surprised downloading web pages take long first expecting. tell you, experimenting supposedly much faster 700p another online carrier one using (i won't say which, really best tell 650 slower dial-up modem 1985), anyway, 650 slightly slower screaming fast 700p 700w. figured something could live honest. hey, it's tiny hand-held device allows send receive email surf web...i'm still amazed something like exists honest you...so downloading speed still secondary opinion. speed really list absolutes, maybe ought move something else...but keep mind, barely faster experienced first hand.one thing: screen amazing. many ways say wow. considering buying palm runs windows mobile, ought know screen clarity almost reduced half. apparently something window's os, seriously put decision buy one back burner.sure things smartphone cannot yet without difficulty impossibility...but current models. serious research want vs. need make informed decision chance go store test specific model personally. matter decide on, likely happy. far, know satisfied choice. good luck yours.***update***i opted get bluetooth hands-free device -- first. originally would see people walking around lt. uhura type thingy's sticking ears couldn't help wonder lazy people cannot raise hand head walking around simply talk phone. part still feel way, decided buy bluetooth hands-free headset driving. cannot afford miss calls, radio, work home found car monitoring radio virtually 100% time unfortunately means sometimes cannot hear ringer. tethered device came phone certainly loud enough, simply fit ear (it kept falling out). bought replacement came variable size adapter yet fit better, sound almost impossible hear (the worst ever experienced, actually). took plunge knowing full-well palm treo somewhat problematic history using devices...so made sure iron-clad return policy place jumped in. took minute configure head-set went ahead made test call enough volume -- fact plenty spare. satisfied performance. (i bought keycera bluetooth, means anything)one additional item requires mentioning: currently call-waiting service treo yet missed least 3 calls (that know of). particular feature seem supported 650...and is, yet discover useful info regarding problem, whether online bible-sized instruction manual. keep looking find solution quickly report asap. one thing think about. otherwise, amazingly satisfied treo otherwise. thing wish (other user-friendly call-waiting) faster downloads online. supposedly possible newer models using evdo yet 700p tested failed work slightly faster 650. maybe network -- according (no surprise there). still think purchase well worth it. 
 it's two weeks treo 650 remember love palm os much. switched blackberry two years ago (7290) i've enjoyed using except very, basic screen. assume that's get remarkable battery life. but, i've switch bb work reasons i'm happily using palm again. last palm palm vx it's still alive kicking many, many years.the treo 650's screen really amazing. and, i've read older reviews treo 650 frequent resetting issue. certainly concerned ready send back problems (cingular gives 30 days try out). far one reset two weeks palm - honestly, reset blackberry constantly i'm sure i'd notice difference. and, bb resets particularly annoying would happen start answering incoming calls literally take 5-8 minutes reset let use again. i'm sure took long - big address book. palm reset took 30 seconds.but, here's treo shines: screen graphics, photos, mp3s videos. put 2-4 movies 2gb sd card, pop palm carry around convenient entertainment. one little feature really impressed ability display screen vertically (it's longer way). letterbox movies really increases size video exceeds size videos zen vision 30gb screen. and, videos really look incredible.and, course, there's ton free software palm. far, i've downloaded tcpmp movies. included realplayer impressive - you're ready listen mp3s right box.final note: i've used palm desktop pim stuff (contacts, calendar, do's) years i'm still impressed it's features easy/quick navigation. they've always ahead pack - know many newer phones come similar pim software pc talk new phone aside blackberry one else even ballpark.you manage photos well even add photos address book you've synced incoming calls display picture caller. know around wasn't available old palm v new blackberry i've using past years. 
 someone used original palm pilot eventually handspring visor visor phone, thought buying treo 650. mixed, sometimes extreme, reviews 650 relatively high price unlocked treo kept away. release next generation treos drmatically forcing price 650 decided take chance. week fairly active use say extremely pleased new treo. bought new unlocked (cingular branded) treo online. phone clarity good mobile phone owned. dropped calls. browswer e-mail client came loaded treo work well. live country fastest mobile data connection still gprs/edge, tro 650 right. easily synced treo macbook problems. $225 + shipping handling $20 say real bargain. 
 love phone!first off, palm functionality wonderful! address book calendar work excellently, cross-functions greatimprovements include sms messaging, much faster includes hyperlinks phone numbers web addresses, unlike treo 600the web faster ---- screen crisperhowever, bluetooth best new feature ----- wireless data transfer is, usually, quick, wireless headphones greatlastly - many complained phone slow functions unstable --- however, ever since system software updated 1.12, made phone much quicker much stable!ordering new phone today come 1.12 software built it, alreadyi former treo 300 600 user, 650 wonderful upgrade worth every penny, considering bluetooth software improvementsalso - you're going gsm, unlocked model great idea, model work gsm network world, depending sim card useso buy it!!! - won't sorryps - cardo scala bluetooth earpiece best earpiece phone 
 send whole credit card sized piece plastic this. it's like christmas kids want play box. yeah, somehow it's exactly like that. 
 much easier buy amazon go store deal sales person. amazon rock. 
 exciting stuff... wooo hooo. plug new 3g sim card new blackberry bold yes works. :) 
 years, household tried multiple bluetooth solutions hands-free communications needs. we've acceptable results solution integrated gps...but much regular driving doesn't include need load full-size gps. we've acceptable results visor-mounted bluetooth speaker unit, let's face it: sometimes want hold conversations don't include everybody car:-)the plantronics voyager 510 proven value overs three years demanding use. fits comfortably ear excellent incoming outgoing audio clarity. best outstanding ability hold charge long time. generally count week charges, even periods heavy use.we liked enough buy three...one driver house. 
 usually don't time write reviews time decided simply help others like tried many different headsets motorola thought probably nothing good market yet. received one gift friend love two simple reasons:1) sound quality excellent. despite fact noisy car drive highway, still hear excellent. actually reduce volume headset volume potential need. tried two headsets motorola past, including hs850. also volume button even set maximum volume can't hear well noisy environment. plantronics provide great quality enough volume noisy environment. also, everyone talked to, told hear well, like speak without headset.2) reason number two - sits perfectly ear. easy insert drive, in, stays there. doesn't move all. unlike motorola headset, fall moves ear takes long time get used fact falling ear. plantronics also provides three different sizes pieces insert ear, makes perfect fit size shape.that say. good headset there. don't need wait more. 
 complaints headset. it's comfortable ear, mute function works flawlessly ps3 krazr! 
 tried everything moto-850 plantronics seeing gold box deal thought heck. amazement really fantastic headset. easy pair, easy adjust volume, great battery life, clear even wind noise city sounds around, last least indicator light look like emergency strobe (i hated mot-850 night would reflect glass dash car side window drive insane...)all 5 star unit 
 owned several bluetooth cell phone headsets, plt 510 best far. fits ear perfectly, wear hours without noticing it, gives great sound. problem syncing iphone, although haven't tried devices, anticipate problems.i two complaints:1. on-off switch small hard use. find push thumbnail make work. smaller fingers, may less problem.2. plantronics uses proprietary connector charging, manufacturers switching mini micro usb. proprietary charging interface means one wire carry me.in summary, great purchase. 
 good bluetooth headset, however recently purchased newer plantronics sound quality smartphone compatibility changed since bought one. still use one cellphones lasted 3 years now. 
 using low-end jabra bluetooth past year, plantronics voyager welcome! paired easily phone different ear cushions, one custom ear canal.while found fit easily onto ear hold well, boyfriend ears flat head hard time hooking ear stay without much adjustment needed. also, said bulky liking, like fine!the sound quality great, hear others well i'm told come clearly. almost 2 months charge besides first time use everyday 1-2 hours time - that's good battery life! 
 works well comfortable, vs couple mot headsets bought, horible. volume level good me, hearing loss, that's impressive well. contols easy use. i'm using older mot v330. highly recommended performance price. oh, contrary another reviewers suggestion, fit mint tin due it's width. haven't found good hard-case solution yet.update 8/16/08:i thought lost 510, reviewing newer units, bought another one! newer models appear riddled minor bugs & issues, stick winner? i'm using t-mobile dash works great voice command features. office trying decide model go with, ordered half dozen latest models headsets. added evaluation pool. two weeks testing, almost everyone liked 510 better rest, ordered 20 them! model discontinued needed new headset, i'd go latest "jawbone"; worked fine, better wind resistance, didn't quite all-day comfort inherent design durability 510. hope helps! 
 really love product. easy use comfortable ear. forget sometime.the quality sound good, clearly hear person talking to. seems hear well.but like price. affordable quality. satisfied headset.thank you! 
 owned 510 almost four years worn nearly eight hours every day. satisfied. cons ear piece block wind background noise well. ear buds getting loose four years, ordering another set those. also ordered new pro plus headset watching product demo wind tunnel. convincing. rate new headset try out. rate, can't go wrong 510. 
 outstanding quality. second plantronics headset i've owned. wonderful. little foam boots sell reduce wind noise don't work. wear mine everyday almost day. comfortable light weight. 
 i've tried motorola ones either couldn't hear person end couldn't hear (usually both). bought based recommendation realtor swore it, honest, occasional trouble it. it's comfortable wear, it's easy hear, person hears me. wear day, project sites, driving, even home. works expected i'm pleased results. need bluetooth, one. 
 tested many bluetooth headsets. one sets bar pretty high. battery life wonderful usually outlasting phone charge factor two. generally compatible regular phones. palm os phone, pick different headset may work, issues find difficult live with.the good: durable headset (mine went washer dryer still works dried days). multiple options ear pieces, flexibility design (switching ears without carrying extra accessories), compatibility lots phones, antenna design solving cross body communications phones, charging options usb power (you wear charging comfortably), battery life great. connects 2 devices time though obviously answer one time.the bad: (all minor) wind smart work great. yet find bluetooth headset handle direct wind noise exception. better remote parties still complain. every headset tested fails here. difficult distinguish mute headset power off. tuned times accident trying mute. oops. mute also alert frequently enough on, still mute phone separately without issues. pairing simple, one button option.i would suggest headset users looking good headset devices. consider options palm os phones. 
 great wind noise reducing headset. works well condition. light weight even though appears bigger units. comfortable fitting headset i've ever used. one negative thing say would sometimes people tell need speak using device rare could possibly device itself. 
 please product also cost got at.

 bought unit converts desk phone bluetooth compatible headset - best buy money! talk phone day office, use desk line cell phone. system allows use headset both. good battery life. 
 is, far, best bluetooth headset ever owned. i've tried motorola ones, pale comparison plantronics. see positive reviews thing amazing. walk house phone one spot, talk without interference. problem always forget put phone! range headset truly amazing.the sound quality amazing well. one ever tell i'm headset. start using this, you'll soon wonder ever lived without it. can't tolerate holding phone ear anymore headset makes life much easier.and i've mine two years without problems. accidentally forgot left sweatshirt pocket washed it, still works! couldn't believe it. sure, battery life suffers years use, they're cheap it's problem get new one.my complaint blue light extraordinarily bright. can't charge thing night without covering it's like blue lighthouse room. it's on, flashing blue light annoying dark rooms (e.g. watching movie). that's really complaint.you really cannot go wrong bluetooth headset little money. don't even think twice! i've recommended heaset 10 different people, love it. 
 little ugly-ish set still ruling market great sound quality owners people talk to. owned tested several supposedly great bluetooth sets several different phones devices including iphone 3g, motorola razr l6, blackberry 7100i, two different laptops (skype) playstation 3, headset performed well plantronics voyager 510.in parallel device three different jabras including bt250, bt500 jx10 neither one comes close sound quality wind tolerance voyager 510. also learned number users including boss switched jawbone 1 2 discovery 925 set due fit, comfort sound issues, never even bothered buy jawbone. plantronics voyager 510, people talk can't even tell i'm using bluetooth headset; even i'm driving, find amazing. since it's four years never ending quest perfect bluetooth headset constantly keep researching reverting little "mule", give five stars spite mainly cosmetic flaws.here's got appreciate somewhat clumsy set much:1. good output volume quality. i'm using plantronics voyager 510, people i'm talking can't tell i'm cell phone bluetooth headset - even i'm driving (windows closed). case opposite using jabras, used hear complaints noise, static low volume voice.2. good controllable earphone volume. reasonably well deal traffic noise i'm walking outside downtown chicago office. set volume really loud, case cannot hear partner i'm walking close moving train. usual volume setting around 1/3.3. set's microphone tolerates wind better jabras mentioned used produce great deal wind noise whenever encountering breeze. addition, know i'll outside windy environment put included microphone sponge on.4. good battery life. don't charge often.5. although seems light gentle hands, handles everyday folding switching shirt pocket ears well.6. problems long usage, unlike jabra bt250, used irritate skin back ear used long often.i never heard plantronics buying headset grew appreciate lot years usage. recently discovered plantronics long history headsets even apollo missions used headsets moon. makes sense. "one small set man, one giant leap away bt headsets. houston, problem". 
 bought one work used year complaints, bought one wife uses constantly loves it. highly recommended. 
 one best headsets there, used many unit one beat. issues whatsoever, great quality easy use.. 
 good sounding ways usable 18 wheeler. mic overwhelmed 75 100db ambient background noise. good noise canceling environments.not good outside wind even new mic grill. 
 product done alot me. i've used multiple phones even ps3 never failed me. great quality headset! easy use link to. dont regret buying it. 
 chose product based reading many reviews plantronics motorola headsets primarily amazon. happy purchase. others said, never know headset. battery lasts day, charger day never even remotely necessary. i've talked 3 4 hours days, day i'm talking, never run battery down. charge get home evening. volume enough (and i'm bit hard hearing). it's comfortable leave time i'm work. works equally well either ear. connects quickly works great. sometimes seems bit hard get on, times slips place. we're talking sometimes takes 10 seconds fiddling get ear right. usually, slips on. wear glasses think that's issue there. highly recommended would purchase w/o question. 
 small ears sometimes use gadget 8 hour conference calls. reason comfort battery life paramount. stays pretty comfortable battery go 4-6 hours. think that's expect bluetooth headset. 
 work verizon wireless tech support department yet use better bluetooth headset. i've owned 4 last year; jabra, motorola, one another plantronics. i've used several different ones time testing process, easily best i've used. earlier plantronics also good well. jabra didn't good noise-reduction motorola terrible purchase altogether. headset say ease superb. great sound, picks little way ambient noise, charge lasts forever, seemingly!update: originally purchased device 2 years ago, di replace back july. why? messenger bag got stepped on. used every day, reason get new headset physically damaged. guess headset got replace it? one! previous one worked 2 years stopped working got stepped on, one i'm sticking long make them. 
 first bought headset $30. worked well 10 (maybe 12) minutes fell apart. so, would suggest considering anything $100.unless consider one.when returned first headset fry's electronics asked popular model was. sales guy said plantronics 510. tried felt really good. i've using two months love pieces. works well moment bought (actually, better, needed charging).positives:1) comfort. biggest attribute looking wear lot. putting usually forget within two minutes. light weight easy ears. remember somebody calls hear beeping ears. flick wrist, easily converts left right ear feel extremely comfortable.2) sturdy. travel lot airports kind belongings, especially ones crammed bag. thing taken lickings keeps going. must better first one bought fell apart nothing.3) great sound quality. i've used airports, casinos, convention centers. always hear party without problems i've never anybody complain can't hear me.4) simple work. probably difficult thing getting recognized phone. isn't complicated took 2 minutes, searching directions it. picking phone easy hitting button.on side note, two bluetooth cellphones switch two automatically without hassle. ease switching considering getting phone base use office line home well. know somebody uses problems it.negatives:1) wish way turn blinking blue light. drives crazy especially driving night. half times see blink think i'm getting pulled over. also, keeps blinking whether using usually cover hand towel charging night. seems inherent bluetooth device.2) ummmm.... can't think negatives.so, highly suggest checking one out. can't say everybody i've learned two ears exactly alike. biggest thing looking comfort. completely comfortable might you. find comfortable would highly recommend picking anything else especially since price soooo right. 
 owned four bluetooth headsets. far comfortable easiest use. problems sore ears models (motorola, jabra bt350 bt800) sometimes forget wearing it. good sound quality, fits well, stays matter what. perfect headset! 
 bought reccomendation friend. brother bought motorolla earpiece $30 paid mine. hates love mine. people never realize talking headset. get 3 ear speakers different sizes attach one comfortable ear.best addition cell phone ever bought. 
 like people purchased multiple bluetooth headsets struggled poor reception, can't hear caller can't hear me. plantronics voyager 510 headset didn't problems. device simply worked used years.the headset operate 6 hours talk time 100 hours standby time ideal use traveling especially driving. noise canceling microphone worked well people could hear background noise like wind rain windshield. earpiece comfortable wear light enough forget on.the headset feature operate two bluetooth devices simultaneously smart technology feature connects proper device touch button. headset boom swivels fit location best even folds small form easy storage. head set operate 33 feet bluetooth device phone briefcase back seat car still take calls.the unit also features adaptive frequency hopping find free channel avoid interference wifi/wlan sources. tried 10 bluetooth devices years one simply one performed best. 
 wireless industry 10 years. ive tried failed several times find great bluetooth headset. came accross unit.to simplify- works perfectly! outside noise, lightweight comfortable.most important, outside interference.its best unit used date. bought two them. one wife myself.i highly recomend unit!!go get it!joel 
 easy set use, excellent sound quality, light comfortable. can't go wrong price. 
 complaints here. excellent sound quality - volume turned nice loud. fewest "bluetooth clicking noises" bluetooth device i've used. hardly hear unless walk far away source.i voyager 510 paired treo 650 skype laptop (using anycom usb 250 reviewed previously) headset picks call whoever rings first every time. love it!! skype call comes in, headset rings - call comes treo 650 headset rings. what's like???i love fit - think it's best i've tried on. also scala 700x light could imagine headset. but, it's almost little light (and fragile). honestly, like need backup. think it, believe wife inherited scala 700x.the 510 feels like it's built take abuse think plus yet it's lighter expected - honest. it's around little afraid might little heavy. i'm pleasantly surprised it's light. mean fit perfect, could go running wearing certainly work gym without worries.i haven't put "wind cancellation" test yet i'll update review. but, honestly, saw positive reviews amazon (1200 so?) many treo 650 users, figured fairly safe bet i'm satisfied purchase far.the scala works great treo 650 too. it's hard tell one sounds louder - i'll experiment little write winner. 
 second headset replacing motorola one came cell phone. people call tell sound clear end cannot tell using headset - sounds like talking phone. case first one. travel lot wear headset long periods. ear get tired sore on. headset seems well balanced never seems like going fall regardless doing. also like folds flat easy carrying shirt pocket. 
 wonderful bluetooth headset. great sound minimal background noise end phone. connected easily sanyo katana ii cellular phone well bluetooth usb device use skype vonage talk accounts. complaint, volume control could easier adjust. end using volume control phone bit easier see level setting at. 
 let's get it. reading review shopping new bluetooth headset, go ahead finishing reading next couple sentences did... buy plantronics voyager 510 amazon (for $45.00 review). 10 different headsets used make hundreds calls types environments, since really rate products curve, currently better choice time (things doubt change one day). stable, ergonomic, static free (there thing completely static free wireless product), efficient it's battery usage, comfortable (a somewhat subjective attribute), bang buck, satisfying use, 5 star rated bluetooth headset money buy. really complain one thing... sensitive microphone pick wind noise moderately windy conditions (in spite noise cancelling technology), certainly true every headset used probably true headsets come it. 
 simply awesome, best one ever had, sticking one 1 motorola, 1 nokia 1 samsung. 
 great bluetooth headset. second one - first stolen purchased one like it. 
 purchased self use motorola v3xx. got home delivory day find husband fallen love it. allready paired blackberry. purchase one self. one problem husband one. able walk 10' phone get crackeling sounds loose ability communicate person phone. love sound quality! love quality get end. person phone says sounds great. 
 motorolla ht850, liked light weight ease turn never loud enough driving. plantronics 510 loud fits well. negative small power switch. all, vote plantronics 
 owned dozen different models bluetooh headsets. best sounding comfortable far. range good, battery life good wish came ear inserts spares. 
 ordered product could talk handsfree car air conditioner running. worked well hoped. 
 reader,i've sony ericsson, logitech mobile freedom, cario scala 500, plantronics discovery 640, finally voyager 510. let say prior favorite logitech little bulky disconnected phone calls (annoying).having said enjoy plantronics voyager 510. higher model, discovery 640 doesn't stand chance. yes 640 smaller, cooler-looking, features good. 640 windguard, noice-cancelling tech, talk time short. extra battery charger give try say boosts talk time not. can't talk charge time. sheesh.okay, voyager 510, love it. great fit. seems plantronics come new version 510. foam mic boom removeable built much like logitech is. voice sound quality top notch. i've recorded sounds clear. even notice difference noise-cancelling technology tv background, voice still clear. noice-cancelling important.pros:clear, audible soundmic sensitive voice callers clearwind-guardnoise-cancelling technology (must have!)fit - stays confortably give 3 earphone-like inserts (perfect)cons:the thing mic boom seems rub cheek close sometimes make scratching sound caller (since it's rubbing cheek). haven't heard complaint reviewers maybe it's unique me. don't big cheeks don't get it. 
 wasn't sure wanted purchase another bluetooth headset last one purchased, motorola hs815, terrible. people saying couldn't hear much static. figured would thing next time. boy wrong. headset terrific. give pros cons:pros:clarityease usebattery lifevery comfortable weardoes fall offthe con is, sometimes difficulty intially putting becasue wear glasses. occassionally use two hands put ear correctly.i would definitely recommend item. 
 smallest cutest bluetooth, certainly reliable experience. i've year still works perfectly, say previous bluetooth devices. 
 i've 3 headsets already, one something didn't like. hesitated buy one, despite great reviews, wanted one didn't give 'telemarketer' look. top things looking were: sound quality, comfort, battery life. unit delivers 3 counts. sounds fantastic, it's really comfortable (especially jabra eargels ear piece), battery lasts long time. looking back, one bought first place. recommended. 
 headset reasonable price provides best hearing talking matter am. size meam heavy. 
 last bluetooth device owned poor reception. sound quality device clear enough hear car windows down. would recommend anyone. great ear piece! 
 plantronics 510 comfortable wear hours doesn't feel like fall ear. mates easily treo 650 also bluetooth-enable laptop, makes possible use laptop voip calls. reception good, volume adequate people talk say voice clear. controls bit stiff, others said. means good tactile feedback -- know you've pressed button.one marginal shortcoming: 510's clarity isn't good enough replace wired plantronics usb headset use dictating dragon systems "naturally speaking" voice recognition software laptop. would stretch wireless headset.prices vary widely; shop around. 
 best product gotten cell phone many blue tooths. one best people hear clearly noise background hear well.... 
 everyone else says, sounds clear, comfortable, sounds crystal clear people listening you. sounds better phone itself. 
 i've 2 years pleased quality, durability, reliability. surprisingly comfortable considering girth piece goes behind ear. past headsets earloops horribly painful short time, one wear hours, barely noticing it. came 3 different earpieces - one small, one large, one teardrop shaped - fit problem. sound quality good enough people frequently comment clear sound nearly always using car. wind cancellation really insufficient, major issue me...i use windows mostly up. frequently leave thing overnight still use couple days afterwards loss power. talk time least 6 hours claimed stand-by time measured days. people troubled proprietary power cord, it's small matter household-type plug car charge driving need be, though cannot charged used simultaneously. came see wanted upgrade another plantronics model pass headset daughter, think i'm going keep buy model.update:still 5 star item second one. 2.5 years first one broke top earloop. taped sports tape kept using without problems, figured matter time didn't work anymore replaced it. others said new 510s junk, i've using mine 5 months it's exactly great original. broken one still working, too. 
 update 11/11/2008my wife's died two weeks ago. emailed company explaining bought amazon mentioned within warranty period. hear anything week, then, replacement appeared house, sent via express mail. refurb, condition, looks works perfectly. awesome customer service. one reason get product!i used month, love it. searching decent bluetooth headset, using month, tell great. sound good clear. complaints anyone speak with, usually don't even know using headset. two negatives, really bad. first, turning easy. really bad thing, little awkward. second complaint would take half star, is, usb car charger cannot work it, buy seperate charger. much easier answer hang up, compared others used. comfortable, sometimes forget wearing it., witnessed wife often reminds tha ti still wearing it. bought wife's set died needed new one. ehem, seems somehow ended one got old piece &$#%(@ (insert guess brand here) used it. well, loves well, though also complains on/off button. also note verizon razor, often would recognize verizon blue tooth headset had, problem quickly hooking headset. really love would recommend anyone. lastly, battery life good. 
 two motorola bluetooth headsets either clear signal speaking someone echo. one got plantronics far best ever i've read best market right now. would advise bluetooth shoppers stay away motorola bluetooth headsets. 
 plantronics voyager 510 bluetooth headset perfect reception transmission.- ear piece & microphonethe reception ear piece clear loud. microphone works flawlessly faithfully relay voice receiving end without little distortion muffles.- bluetooth functionthe bluetooth provides rock-solid connectivity. i've never problems broken sporadic connection problems.- formthe ear piece comfortable. take effort, however, put headphone. somewhat awkward maneuver involves use hands pull "loop" open go around back ear simultaneously wrestling ear piece direct ear.the plantronics voyager 510 bluetooth headset functions flawlessly. however, found design headset makes inconvenience put on. apart flawed ergonomics, headset perfect - 4.5 stars! 
 waited review product see time would show good, show that. best blue tooth device ever seen used already convinced 3 people switch. battery lasts would guess 8 hrs talk time 2-3 weeks without charge using little day. sound better using phone people hear without static. improvement think put battery meeter let know much power left instead dying you. try charge every 1-2 weeks dies great. 
 bought two gf myself, high quality easy use. like it! 
 unit always synchs works perfectly. every time. comfortable good volume, easy adjust end calls. hassles. strong battery life. subtle much behind ear, definitely goofy looking star-trek-look devices bright led's ear hardware. (i think law wear one those, wear two, thus identifying hopeless techno-geek.) 
 reviews available product amazon website really helped make great decision.this model may "latest" technology it's enough me. use car issues raised driving safety. feel better hands wheel, eyes road.i'm device geek really works requirements have.simple use, set 10 min max.fits fine, activate connection go road buttons small difficult activate already behind ear. 
 people talk using earpiece can't even tell bluetooth. windnoise static. little big, sacrifice something order get good sound. 
 jabra headset work pda/phone, works well. but, new ca law regarding phone use car, needed one could switch two phones. remarkably well.although cannot switch conversation easily (you hold call button beeps twice release call phone mic/speaker could pick call, easy way switch back), handles obvious uses well. one phone starts ringing, headset correctly selects pick call - perfect.the headset comfortable long calls, good balance ear.the microphone stalk movable product brief suggests, fold per se (sticks matter positioned). folding mic power off, shame, although battery life seems really good.sound quality good speaker appears good end, although heard side know sure.only downside vs. jabra usb charger (small cord plug laptop traveling), drag along transformer. 
 plantronics voyager 510 absolute work horse past nearly 2 years. say workhorse mean it. put 5 hours talk time device 5 days week well year. used weekly 4 hour commute, day office, night talk family hotel number usages. know device using familiar turning blinker car.the good:1. great noise filtering. microphone great job filtering ambient noise including wind.2. battery excellent lasts days standby least 6 hours talking.3. multipoint technology. technology rocks. work (blackberry) personal cell phone synched device time call answer either without pairing hassles.4. pairs device setup simply pressing primary button.5. volume buttons earpiece.6. comes multiple earpieces comfort.7. stable ear. doesn't feel fall out.8. durable. used hard years started fall apart. still works though.9. shares common power supply many plantronics devices ease power sharing.10. larger competitors light.the good:1. bigger devices.2. earpieces prone fall don't stay secured 6 months.as see really don't much bad say device. replacing 2 years use earpiece fell can't find pack came it. still works! replaced unit plantronics discovery 925 might like even better. money though cannot beat voyager 510 opinion. 5 stars! 
 best bluetooth owned performance importantly fit. comfortable ear inside ear, could keep hours even remember there. sound quality features excellent worked advertised. used various phones. used every day 2 years started break hinge. used stuff purse without special case protection, surprised finally gave in. see product sold lot $$$ now, don't think paid $40 it. great deal great value. see sale again, would buy it. 
 i've able carry conversations bedroom bathroom phone sits living room! reception amazing. travel beyond 30 ft different parts apartment still get clear calls. friends can't tell i'm bt headset. fact, say it's clearer wired earpiece. problem dropped calls plummeted almost nothing position phone decent area talk wherever plantronics bt.this ugly headset compared others, works! there's point cute bt can't use it. use smallest earpieces provided, stays pretty well. 
 yes, three headsets. two car, one use house. chose put best one, one, car along second cheap one, backup. i'm terrible remembering charge guys up! i'm cheap purchase car charger...this really great headset. i've never problem people able hear it's comfortable wear. battery lasts long time, one reason forget charge it. battery dies, use backup headset charge favorite!the headsets cheapy models i've purchase amazon goldbox deal, also good. around $10 work fine. comfortable wear sound quality sharp, speaking with. wear cheapy ones 15 minutes, ear start ache little. wear one day wanted wouldn't bother all.i would purchase one sure. i've mine 18 months i'm sure point trash need another. i'm really happy headset. 
 best bluetooth had. clear comfortable. others tried hurt ear one never does. it's like aren't even wearing it. clear people talking well clear talking. can't go wrong headset all. 
 couldn't happier this. embarrassed "large" size may want consider less insecure. 
 never bluetooth headset 510. use motorola i870 nextel phone. headset works great, sometimes disconnects moment press button side headset reconnects. talk time awesome gotten almost 5 hours continuous talk time device. range isn't bad think get 30 feet i870. crappy nextel phone could keep quality headset. since i870 battery goes dead like 1 1/2 extended batter pack plug charge. however, it's plugged still use 510 wander house still talk phone. almost replaces phone could dial it. best part get far away gets little static know come back closer sound quality clears up. everyone spoken headset says sounds nice clear.overall would suggest headset anyone works, it's cheap wears extremely comfortable ear. 
 i've earpiece years still works well day one . never problems; never falls ear. sound great. 
 ever since bought headset become fan it. comfortable wear whole day without even feeling anythin on, voice crystal clear easy use. pairs perfectly nokia 6610 well dell laptop use voip calls mobile phone calls. also service great. received package right estimated date never followup anyone. superb product !!! 
 difficult find bluetooth headset work well palm treo. one does. good quality sound cut out. 
 i've owned used several different models couple years, 510 hands best i've used far. battery life excellent, fit excellent, sound quality mic quality excellent. got mine price temporarily dipped $40, cannot beat price. highly recommended. 
 gave one away 2 years ago, failed stay paired bb pearl. decided give another try motoqglobal (att), thoroughly satisfied. reception great, audible signal every function, including receipt e-mail text messages. great purchase $40!!update 8/5/2009: stopped working, warning. warranty, unfortunately. 
 previously used motorola hs850 hs820 two problems each. insuffcient volume insecure attachment ear. whenever moved, motorola headsets wiggled made feel fall off. never still annoying. volume problem part related this. contact ear wasn't firm ambient noise headsets let coupled relatively low volume meant press headset ear hear clearly.i satisfied plantronics 510. choice 3 interchangable ear cushions, great volume, crisp output decent range make unbeatable. battery life somewhat less motorola headsets, purchased extra charger home. power button small, using minor problem resolves little practice. sound crisp clear. range good better motorola sets. 
 headset proved pleasant surprised tryinga bunch others. definitely comfortable, hadgreat sound actually fits ear. variable ear piecesare great touch unit fit larger ears better.sound quality good. downside slightly hardto manipulate buttons. minor.if you've tried bunch can't get good fit, try one,it'll probably work - me. 
 3rd one ran one car wore one out. good. 
 read lot buying headset kind nervous bad reviews read must say worthy headset really good, hear perfectly using it, doesn't hurts ear anything, don't use like everyday battery last almost week far. samsung captivate didn't problem pairing using it.5 stars! 
 several years used logitech bluetooth cell phone, worked great, always uncomfortable. snapped two, decided voyager 510! wow, work great, very, comfortable! fact, honestly say actually forget wearing it, something cannot say previous device. thinking headset, cannot go wrong one! five stars! 
 voyager 510 comfortable wear easy setup. speaker volume good little static. plus doesn't look like block plastic hanging ear. highly recommend headset. 
 last 2 years, tried 10 different models bluetooth headsets different manufacturers. far, voyager 510 best around performance - clarity, loudness, battery standby time, pairing, static free, ...if pick one negative thing say would size. quite bit bigger competing products small prize pay superb performance.get one, you'll glad do. 
 i've tried several different bluetooth headsets motorola cardo, ended returning giving away them. kept plantronics 510 simply best ever tried. hear static, cracks pops, audio quality tops caller, it's comfortable doesn't flop around ear like headsets move.while plantronics may seem slightly larger headsets (mainly larger part goes behind ear), comfortable wear use, light. slips pocket bag easily bluetooth headset.the plantronics 510 comes 3 different sizes earbuds fit ear perfectly speaker goes (or close to) ear, unlike headsets speaker rests outside ear really good getting high volume windy/noisy environments. also plantronics boom mic folds partway towards mouth. way better headsets mic way ear closer mic mouth, better sound less background noise callers hear. everyone i've talked using plantronics raved good sound, especially compared crappy motorola's i've tried previously.the voyager 510 great battery life talking standby. bluetooth range superb-i effectively walk around condo room room, talking phone, yet cellphone remains computer desk-it really goes 30 feet, walls too. fact headset even remember pairing multiple devices icing cake.i really recommend headset. it's money well spent. go ahead try others, would educated guess end one eventually, like did.*there slightly misleading bit text instruction manual regards charging aware of: states led illuminate red charging illuminate blue done charging. however actually blinks red charging turns solid blue complete. 
 tried many, one one use driving noisy truck. 
 three identical phones three different bluetooth headsets. plantronics explorer 320, motorola h350, plantronics voyager 510. three, plantronics superior comfort sound quality, 510 outstanding respects. although little bulkier others, much comfortable callers actually feel sounds better using handset. result, don't use handset unless to! 
 strength high rating huge reviewer feedback amazon, bought bluetooth device -- first bluetooth headset ever. finally phone bluetooth capability, keenly interested wireless headset wouldn't cord tangle issues corded headsets.this device exactly wanted do. piece cake setup verizon samsung u540 phone. wouldn't even need crack open user manual except discover 4-digit code plug-in phone (it's 0000, btw). that, it's snap turn link phone.my important concern voice clarity, sending receiving. thus far, several hours use, tell voice reception hear crystal clear. crackling, hollowing echoing. end, i've anyone complain unable hear voice voice coming across muddled -- interestingly, i've complaints using old, corded headset!the power button *is* small *is* tad difficult depress might want, then, won't accidentally turn turn device way it's designed. agree others -- turn device putting ear, you're turning off.as noise canceling, wife tested device noisy home four small kids, pleasantly surprised well headset communicated voice ambient noise room.using volume control headset pretty easy do. note control voice volume either phone handset volume control control plantronics headset. reviewers complaining low volume headset, it's likely one two volume controls turned low, perhaps mobile phone using doesn't much way signal output. plantronics headset *plenty* loud volume that's want.as ear comfort, found comfortable, although haven't worn day long. talked friend hour yesterday, absolutely discomfort all. device comes three earpieces (small, medium large). use medium great results.the phone fits snuggly ear doesn't move around all, although i'm jogging even walking much using it.i like discreet look "guts" device behind ear, thin microphone side face, rather fat motorola designs.other reviewers cautioned headset breaking, take gentle care handling it. suspect won't problem falling apart.i can't speak battery life, lengthy phone call, recharge it's ready next call might make. charging easy doesn't take long, either.in sum, i'm satisfied device. long doesn't break, it's performance comfortable design make excellent choice. 
 bought razr v3 phone july go 7-eleven speak wireless prepaid service. phone received amazon.com made hong kong market, came outlet plug adapter u.s. customers. (the ac adapter universal voltage, slim paper manual english.) phone quadband fully unlocked, used anywhere world.i really like razr phone. it's solid voice quality excellent. speak wireless runs at&t; t-mobile networks reception quality vary, overall razr excellent job pulling much signal possible. moto phones, brightness screen adjusted, ringer type volume easily changed. metallic keypad takes little getting used to, pretty comfy use.the camera vga takes good-quality pictures there's plenty light. video capture jerky limited 15 seconds, that's probably weakest feature me. bluetooth linkup sony ericsson earpiece works fine. battery life admirable; don't use phone much, maybe 10 minutes week, need recharge every 8 days so.because i've owned many moto's like razr's interface, since feels familiar, understand confuse users new moto scene. overall, though, don't think it's harder use sony nokia.what really impresses build quality phone. nowhere find thing made, material fit finish excellent. i'm happy inexpensive purchase.

 agree poster. blame phone broke screen. monitor home bad dropped table. phone best smart phone there. people issues resets, conflict many apps load usually solved. love phone. also...do rate 1 star say phone good, verizon bad. unfair since lowers rating. ignore guy broke phone...this good phone. 
 first "smart phone" can't compare previous models. however, tell great need:1. great wireless service coverage. verizon best coverage provider. even signal elevators stairwells.2. text messaging. job requires carry pager. phone, forwarded pager. carry one device. great responding pages initiating message dialog. 1,000 messages plan, plenty. handy meetings able ping people back desk information.3. organizer. installed software pc work, outlook calendar available wherever take phone. one thing didn't like lack options initial sync. wound "frequent contacts" outlook phone - includes anyone ever sent e-mail to. luckily, easy filer contacts delete them. sure set device overrides desktop contacts.i don't use web e-mail pieces data package expensive (~$45/mo). unless need send receive attachments, sms sufficient e-mail. web queries done sms services like google provides.overall it's great! 
 briefly:this inexpensive wire allows easy transfer media files - photos, drm-free music, videos, etc. sony ericsson phone computer usb port.it useful phone users interested 'phone calls only' plan willing pay phone company extra monthly charge internet service.it needed sony ericsson phones support standard usb interface 'normal' usb cable work._______________________________________extended discussion:i'm surprised wife's sony ericsson's tm506 came without usb interface wire. 'free' phone phone company wished could nickel dime us forever 'plans' make us pay various monthly service fees privilege downloading couple songs uploading photos videos made using phone's camera. sony ericsson's phones lacking standard usb interface probably intimidating enough persuade users succumb phone company's demand extra $10 per month 'web' access. need way.since wanted phone made phone calls inexpensive wire allows us squeeze extra functionality free phone allowing us transfer media files phone connecting computer. it's easy, requires software installation don't need pay one extra dime phone company privilege.positives:- eliminates need pay phone company internet connection- software installation required- file transfer actually faster- allows easy media files transfer computer - drm-free files easily send phone- even users internet plan may appreciate ability connect phone directly computerconcerns:- minimal computer skills expected - ability recognize specific file types copy move to/from specific foldersconclusion: recommended sony ericsson phone user, without media internet plan. 
 use charge phone laptop/pc. also use debrand add pics, music, apps computer phone.. works great. 
 surprised quickly received it. little hesitant opened package small zip lock bag, manufacturer brand packaging. tried works great oem models. would recommend it. also, perfectly priced! 
 hard write review cable. works supposed do, 
 special installs necessary. cable, sony ericsson w3001 showed windows xp system another drive. works great. cool. 
 needed usb connector old sony ericsson w518a - works great! pc sees phone connected problem! 
 im pleased little charger. blue light indicates whether it's on, phone charges fast. five minutes it's three quarters charged bring dead! would definitely recommend someone else. 
 needed power source mini usb. exactly needed. also delivered fast. use power rca hdmi converter roku 3. 
 yea, basically. it's phone charger motorola razor, guess what? works it. also works phones. 
 charger come charge mp3 players like it's supposed to. shipping longer paid for. however thought charger disconnected charger cable could come base connect computer i'll order another charger need do. 
 charged phone. actually, bought six would correct say &#34;they&#34; charged phone.why would get six? one bedroom, one kitchen, one living room, one home office, one car, one work. phone full electricity, i'll tell that. 
 incredibly frustrated purchased product find work charge phone specifically bought for. christmas present someone relied car charger years. she'd plug car outlet let sit car charged. assumed solved problem. unfortunately, motorola razr dinosaur, i'd special order actual manufacturer.here's surprise part......i moved finally found kindle. it's kindle touch, nothing special (not fire paperwhite). it's simply black white touch screen. unfortunately, couldn't find charger, matter looked! even so, charger came kindle would take 2-3 hours fully charge, it's nearly dead. so,i decided try kindle see would fit. surprise, fits like glove! that, also charged kindle hour. dead, refused turn plugged charger. still, fully charged within hour. go figure! 
 love compact headset. fits well ear, comfortable. mic picks well, clear voice coming through. pleased purchase going get spares sure. feels like solid build durable. 
 i've using headset (although mine doesn't call answer button like version does) years now. it's first headset i've ever used comfortable great sound quality directions, i've used 3 different phones years results. hear people perfectly i've never single comment much less complaint sound quality people. comes two different size gels ear, spare you're totally set. depending shape ear may prefer one ear gels.this headset comfortable wear ear hours time without bothering me, stays snugly cheek doesn't flop around slightest. don't know gotten bad reviews site, sites averages least 4 stars many, many reviews. bottom line, i'd gladly pay 2 3 times amazon charging headset, especially answer call/end button it. 
 love these, bought brands break months. last good product. 
 highly recommend anyone using cordless home phone. fan bluetooth, seems easiest use around house. 
 worry headset would work samsungt619, since latter compatibility list. hand, i've heard bluetooth devices standard (i.e. version 1.2) compatibility problem. turned absolutely smooth connecting samsung. headset flash even vibrate call's coming.the headset amazingly light weight. can't even imagine lithium battery sitting leather-weight body hold 7 hours' talking.i spent $10 headset couldn't happy. 
 first question headsets comparing to. see reviews motorola hs850, jabra bt250v, plantronics 320 explorer reference. let's consider headset terms four key performance categories: pairing, sound quality, ease use, comfort.pairing - able pair headset lg vx-9800 first try. instructions manual straightforward repeat hear. experience similar bt250v.sound quality - really top area question headset. i'm happy report headset delivers nicely area. able use less max volume setting cases definite progress headsets used. end, important don't volume louder need otherwise people hear echo due close proximity speaker microphone. however, found echo less issue hs850.ease use - key jabra headset holding multifunction button flashes. turns headset pairing. hear reports people winding redialing last number called trying turn headset off. don't wait flash, happen. i've also heard reported pairing, shouldn't case start pairing headset turned off. finally, volume buttons easy use. use headset right ear can't speak like headset flipped buttons top.comfort - also found headset clear winner area three used. wear glasses ear hook necessity. think also hit sweet spot placement speaker. speaker raised surface headset opposed hs850 flush main body headset. however, go ear like bt250v plantronics 320. guess another way put rests outside ear canal speaker close inside ear without actually so. think maximizes comfort contributes better sound quality. finally, vibrate feature disturbing used it. don't let stop though something turn desire. 
 comfortable wear, good reception, price ~$22 plus shipping unreal. prefer style star trek earpieces, one's boom mic extends ear models series. 
 bought phone ofr in-laws months ago works great. unfortunately, don't get see phone often. unless something better, next phone. 
 one person said review "while phone thin, bulky handle, seems flimsy."i could disagree more. feels extremly sturdy, tiny phone, thin. weighs would expect, don't mind feels bit well made.i version motorola v557 well year now. got free, gave friend needed phone badly. cingular customer. wanting new phone anyways worked well.i got nokia 6102 one two weeks ago. say good deal price didn't like all. returned got razr. spent bit razr, reasonable. (...).the razor simple phone, good phone. comes pretty case make happy every time open it! good quality camera (it's digital camera, like good quality web cam) find easy read, dial everything clear spaced nicley.i got black version, nick named kit night rider car, reminds it. yeah dork!i read complaints phone didn't come enough stuff, well it's launch price point would say yeah overpriced. come good deal book.i pleased far! pleased enough come write review!i also love cool accessories get, including vynle(sp?) skins color want. 
 purchased item back, remember great item. would definitely recommend it. 10 years, still att. 
 personally think black edition razr phone looks really cool, better regular silver version. phone otherwise identical silver twin... but, really, looks cool -- you'll differentiate crowd.the phone capable packed features. unlike high-end moto phones year two back, one works well decent interface. everyone know phone simply loves it.[...]

 motorola h300 ultimate handsfree headset want headset able use forever. say this? because, non-removable rechargeable battery like handsfree headsets. instead, operated single aaa battery. got it, cannot verify performance battery, knowing won't throw away couple years worth it. features include call accept, call deny, mute, hold, voice dialing, 3 way calling, turn blinking blue light (if you're inclined). even though takes aaa battery, it's size comparable rechargeable headset. may 2 mm thicker, length most. works great nonsense kind headset. want basic headset expensive ones, want security changing battery, headset you. problems duration battery operation, update review accordingly (check date review gauge long since purchase... update, problem). 
 keep one desk, one bag, one car.battery life fantastic -- standby talk. i'm afraid turning on, pop battery compartment thumb. easy pie.pairs easily.perfect comfortable ears.great sound, ways.i've used devices old motorola pebl iphone (1st gen) palm pre.i've bought inherited 7 bluetooth devices getting one years ago, thinking would improve something already well-made. didn't...so got two h300's.turns aaa battery route (i use rechargeable eneloops) works great me... years, it's never bother... don't even notice it. there's nothing plug wall, extra charger, i've always got spare aaa charged house, bag, car "emergencies."i love thing... back amazon today order one mom try convince use one things. liked idea aaa battery maybe plug ones wall slowed much.if get one amazon sellers get one new half/third cost todays date (3-29-2011).i'm sure technology bluetooth headsets improved that's said high-end pos received friends tried get "the best" 3x price. think i'll wait awhile longer messing good thing got going moto h300s.good luck!

 second one wore first one three years broke well worth money spent works great pairs easy last far talk time full eight ten hours worth money. 
 headset inexpensive, sound quality great. paired samsung d807 couple seconds. ear piece goes ear, outside noises less distracting. old motorola headsets, people complained couldn't hear me. hasn't issue 320. 
 owned unit three weeks now. got unit close price, feel definitely got money's worth. never owned blue-tooth head set nothing compare to. read reviews internet decided unit wanted price range. sound clear intelligible ends,... far tell, even car, bought for...(to use driving)... fairly comfortable 2 hours ware, becomes somewhat uncomfortable. think adjustment may possible make feel even comfortable, lot comfort depends sensitivity, ear head shape. paired phone, razr v3, reconnects time matter seconds (usually). take longer. buying headset never hear plantronics before, would say products good build quality good sound. liked units motorola headsets mostly way fit rather sound quality issue. 
 recently bought new cell phone (sony ericsson z520a) bluetooth. spent days researching various headsets there, soon discovered handful appeared worth buying -- $100 $150, want spend. came across accident, couldn't find negative comments common headsets price range. granted they're bluetooth v1.2, they're light, built-in rechargable battery, quite comfortable wear, good sound quality. addition, pairing process quite simple.if priorities quality sound, comfort, built-in battery, reasonable price, hard beat. like much bought second one wife. 
 item came within time great got mom currently still using order year ago. 
 purchased headset use cell phone. turns use computer love them. easy use, long battery lfe sound great. may bit uncomfortable odd back head design headphones kind pressure due design. time notice presure wear hours. short term problems. way, wear glasses may culprit.i'd buy again. 
 product, ordinary earphones moto680 cellphone stero radio, also moto blue tooth earphone, one good, long time power supply heavier single ear bluetooth.volumn control good, loud enough. single ear bt control times, may hear nothing walking busy street windy days. one give availability.drawback: 1. phone call comes in, wait longer time single ear bt. 2. size big, put regualr pocket. 3. pad easily drops, may lose one two soon. used glue.anyway, good one, talk 2 hours meeting several times one time full recharging.i love it. 
 durable. sounds great. mic provides good sound endof connection. like wrap-around fit (walkman-style headphones look dorky - wrap around better). although.. 30 minutes tips ears become sore learning cope with. use motorola l2 cell phone anycom 250 usb dongle skype. one get. competing plantronics product -- fact two -- broke place due use plastic high-stress areas. motorola design much smarter. 
 got headset last week wednesday using ever since. read lot reviews found much information could even ordering it. reading mixed reviews, find myself.so is:i use motorola q, also bad phone, works perfectly fine it. paired without problems stays connected want stay connected. opportunity really test battery life yet, tested approx 2 hours charges holds fine 2 hours.incoming sound quality perfect. actually little loud, lower volume.outgoing sound also much better according girlfriend heard previous sony hbh-660, says sound quality much better. even windows rolled going 65, says hear fine, although says sounds like faucet running. question dsp works since doesn't really filter windnoise.the system pretty sleek gives multiple charging options. worry running battery unless talk consistently 3 hours time.one gripe button plastic. button easier press require much pressure does. plastic seems kind cheap, probably makes thing light, barely even notice on. use better plastic better chrome paint doesn't scratch chip off.overall, give 2 thumbs best headset used far. 
 airports watching people talking space huge clam attached ear flashing blue light swore bluetooth. headset plantronics extremely small, nicely packaged, paired immediately blackberry 7100t.the packaging cleverly done headset simple silver cylinder weights mere 9 grams. audio quality high recent 7100t software upgrade increased volume levels acceptable. variety included ear pieces ensure you're likely find comfortable fit. i've getting 2-3 hours talk time single charge perfect adequate people.as small minus, button connect/disconnect/turn-on takes bit getting used feels bit mushy missing positive click confirm selection.if you're worried compatibility, plantronics website provides pull selector mfg/phone confirm.

 i'm impressed headset. set simple se k700i phone. paired two devices added handsfree mode. headset light extremely comfortable ear. move gel earpiece left use right ear additional comfort. conversely, move gel earpiece right use left ear. fits well ear don't need use ear loop.the sound clarity great. everyone talk says hear well. needed raise volume little hear everyone perfectly. don't hear static whatsoever use headset wifi bluetooth networks home.plantronics gives lot charging options. use se charging adapter, snapped bottom little pocket case, could use one charger two gadgets. headset comes nokia, samsung, siemens sony ericcson adapter charging. headset also comes charger, case don't one 4 phone models, use wall outlet. tried method charging works fine too.this headset also comes mobile charger case, use aaa battery. didn't try method charging since se car charger works well included se adapter.voice dialing works fine. that's important since i'm mobile professional spends lot time traveling car.the headset beep right make call. also beeps right signals name want call. don't find irritating, one reviewer mentioned. that's headset operates. let emphasize headset works great.it best bluetooth headset i've ever owned. 
 fits like glove, good design, got today im impressed. really like seperates volume buttons well power button. also makes easier push. wouldnt trust save screen 3 foot drop ordinary use think serve well.. also material good feel it. slippery. 
 nice rubber case fits snugly around nexus.i like protect small drops bumps. would means expect protect full fledged fall smash concrete. good don't plan throwing dropping heights seem little slips good that. happy product 
 honestly love case. first sort skeptical back design, get though, obviously needs two textures add grip one make smooth enough fit pockets additional friction it. 
 tpu cases it's usually hit miss. one, nexus 7 happy tablet. back area flat, slick, x area sides retain textured area works well holding hand. often surf web watch videos bed problems case slippy. money great case probably best get $10. 
 large enough hold pod touch otter box case mytouch problem, guess hold portable device cell phone market. grips work well fall once, licked put back haven't problems sense. don't use vent holder looks like might work played while. 
 i've another bluetooth headset two years. i've never happy performance-it small light, freeway speeds could hear party.i purchased headset four days ago. could happier. morning sat head long commute, forgot within 5 minutes. road wet, even accentuated tire noise could hear every word. made several calls, one person aware car.i slight audio discrimination problem, makes hard hear noise. headset leatherette ear cushion fits ear, blocking noise. also turned quite loud, uncomfortably so. great, never wanting volume.it comes wall charger car charger, i'll never carry one house charge it.look photos buying: notice big headset. that's part makes work well, want compromises inherent tiny designs, don't buy this.update: another week, i'm still totally excited product. couple days ago ran conference call cell phone, car. one parties lousy speaker phone. could hear perfectly.update one year (january 2009): keeps working. still pleased punch. battery still lasts forever. 
 best headset truckers. back ground noise heard caller. ear pices right volume. mice takes use it. talk, talk normal voice. don't speak heard. put mice mouth, distort sound. best place lower lip. paring done every time turn headset on. automatic paring turn on. good thing easy to.the charge time great really holds charge stand-by talk time. thing don't like heavy sometimes mice gets caught shoulder strap, looking side side. 
 drive truck found hard finding good bluetooth headset. many tried worked fine, biggest problem party could hear (because engine noise). accidentally found one gave try. awesome. people think talking straight phone. call quality opinion even better use headset.pros:- perfect voice quality- battery lasts long- noise cancelling microphone makes others hear you- solidcons:- bulky- expensive (but worth money) 
 i,m truck driver headset perfect use trucks, friends turned model. used others said noise cancelling nice job car soon used truck one could understand me. blue parrot nice quiet sound it, everyone says sound good also cup earpiece turn volume blows hear well it. thing ever heard close plantronics 510 earpiece even close

 gave headset wife uses time. works great comfortable. 
 first want say, low cost bluetooth headset great value. lot bluetooth heasets choose market today. many stylish bells whistles, $30.00 headset one best values there. pink version cute offers perfect color match versizon v3 series motorola pink razr. however, believe gentle pink color stylish element headset. take away pink left generic looking earpiece.now lets talk performance. h500 couldn't eaiser use. paired daughter's verizon motorola pink razr seconds, button configuration unit makes perfect sense. buttons gentle action yet offer satisfying "click" feel pushing them; mushy feeling all. sound quality speaker quite good acceptional. voice quality microphone impressive. phone daughter, actually sounds much better headset using razr phone alone. tend pickup great deal background noise though, may best noisey environments. h500 sits stable manner daughters ear. ear hook soft flexible worn extended periods without discomfort. look feel fall ear even tipping head.i giving headset full 5 stars. rate h500 highly outstanding style, rather simple functionality, solid performance, great build quality overall value money. can't get better bluetooth headset $30.00! highly recommend headset woman looking cute color match verizon moto razr, also seeking comfortable fit impressive performance. may better looking headsets there, you'll likely suffer penalties cost and/or performance. 
 light weight simple use. charger bad agfa store sent new one fast. 
 one best purchases i've made on-line. h700 big upgrade (previously used h500). complaints whatsoever. love fact turn headset closing it. small face & small ears -- dainty piece perfect! 
 compact, stylish, comfortable. currently one headsets known work well htc mogul. wear day never run charge, sometimes even forget wearing lighweight comfortable. amazon top pricing product too. could buy two i'd pay full retail elsewhere. sound clear end receiver's end. great product great value. 
 i've spent last two weeks ordering returning bluetooth headsets. finally, going quite models (motorola h350, motorola h500, plantronics 655, nx6000), found great one. willing pay $150 headset comfortable, easy use, -- importantly -- callers didn't complain about. headset great sound quality ends, setup buttons easy use. boom folds out, headset turns on. fold back, headset turns off. several headsets tried terrible buttons -- small hard work without looking mirror. great.i really looking forward writing review tonight i'm hoping help someone else avoid research (cnet, endless googling) find one trial error.look further, you've found great headset! buy now!(and no, don't work motorola!! haha) 
 h700 replaces hs810, smaller, lighter seems work well similar battery life. cost less ! 
 ...i paired razr v3 phone. sound quality excellent, receiving sending. loud enough hear rather noisy car without problem. one i've talked complained sending sound quality all--most didn't know using headset. pairing simple worked according instructions.the headset fits well, doesn't problem glasses, isn't particularly noticable i'm wearing it. buttons logical work well.the charger razr charger (same voltage/current connector), two chargers used either device...and charge headset using car charger got razr. handy! think charger compatability seal deal razr users--in opinion, definitely bluetooth headset get razr.the negative manual, like manual razr phone, imcomplete. instance, although container says pair eight devices, could figure pair additional devices, switch devices. wish motorola would invest writing production proper manuals--or least make full manual accessible web, don't want clutter manual people features folks won't use.oh...and i'd also like able wear thing without put standby mode...but given little energy standby mode uses, that's really big deal. perhaps motorola made microphone boom switch always switch headset off, switch unless press big button, least option. 
 h500 stoped working went get h700 like much better. sound quality good better h500 h700 better features h500 would listen mp3 sounds razor would much better 
 recently purchased razr v3. tried several headsets without luck.hs805 uses battery, best soundhs815 - okh300 - poor - low volumem500 - poor - lower 300, beepshs850 - good design, poor volume (again, low) highest setting, constantly beepsplantronics 640 - joke, falls apart hand. little pieces everywhere.the h700 - finally good quality headset! callers problems hearing me... problem hearing road. quiet car, always found pressing headset ear order hear conversations. case h700. thing volume galore! fact, bump ticks, works great highway speeds. it's comfortable... (unbelievably light) think 850 small.... 700 truly 30% smaller moto claims. closed, thing hide behind .50 cent piece. buttons easy operate feel. anyone uses headset regularly knows adjusting opposing buttons challenging - h700. place top bottom rest finger need adjust easily. pairing setup took 1 minute. sound crystal clear. thing bells whistles. works promised right box. 4 stars design operation. one plug home car fits all, 5 stars top notch product. 
 purchased bluetooth headset two main reasons. first, uses charger motorola razr rim blackberry 8700c. secondly device easily turns time extend microphone.i've used 1/2 dozen bluetooth headsets one favorites.here summarized pros cons:pros:-uses charger motorola razr phones-open/close microphone turn headset on/off-small, lightweight easy put (one handed eve)cons:-only connects one bt device time. razr blackberry carry everywhere. two devices cannot h700 connect simultaneously (other bluetooth products - notably plantronics) able connect simultaneously two devices.i recommend headset, amazon competitive pricing available. easily beating even discount superstores i'd seen 50% more. 
 imho slightly better moto hs850. it's smaller, lighter. boom smaller. that's issue, equal imho.now problem people cannot hear you, sound muffled away phone. wearing bluetooth, look mirror see boom touches cheek beard it'll touch that. note small hole inside boom gets sound. anything touches impede voice....it's like putting towel regular phone talking someone. need puffy cheeks problem happen. unless narrow face, chances happen you'll blame bluetooth!to fix this, get either neoprene tubing sticky foam one end (mole skin) cut small piece put hinge near boom smaller piece (if needed) top other. make space cheek boom people hear you! still able close boom. 
 recently dropped land line went 100% wireless telephone service; change, wanted make sure didn't suffer numb arm talking smaller cell phone longer periods wanted use hands-free approach. previous experiences satisfying back day earbuds dangling wires. but, new cellphone came bluetooth wireless capability, opened new world options.i played number store, didn't get real world experience them. but, really liked design feel h700. research - much reviews amazon; left bit skeptical many unfavorable reviews written - mentioned negatives like poor sound quality, minimum range, bluetooth connective problems name few. but, decided side review read positive reviews amazon.the bottom line happy h700. experienced absolutely problems - people talked hear fine, hear them; h700 7 feet phone reception problems; h700 easy setup phone (lg vx8300) immediately connects whenever turn device on.feature-wise, h700 great! buttons easy use understand flip mic great idea...the phone rings, flip open (keep closed conserve power) call answered immediately; flip closed end call powers well. h700 also features button answering ending calls don't want power unit.i highly recommend motorola h700 bluetooth headset choose - yet find negative it.

 lot batteries around area, 1 locate wasn't nearly cheap, works great. sure else say good battery. 
 product looking for, little delay delivery complain, lot cheaper getting retail, wait worth wait. complain, recommend 
 charged battery used sell phone one time good battery, know keeping spare, till one stops working. 
 battery great! shipped immediately even arrived almost full charge. finish charging use lasted almost week, although don't use phone lot. looks works exactly like original well worth price. 
 ability leave mp3 music (cell phone) gym bag get serious workout without disruption worth price along. call, it's also important don't miss important phone calls. getting interrupted voice announcement who's calling makes worthwhile. first use hooked. weekday workouts bluetooth stereo headset. weekends, i'm back zune, dislike headphones, need escape phone. 
 i'm using product past 5 months b'ful awesome sound quality. didn't found issue product. easy configure connect. works sony erricson w580i walkman phone well laptop. sound quality beats good. distortion u move head 90% left, ignorable. bulky fit easily. build mic good. playing music call comes u atend headset. volume adjustment. overall, good peace makes fully satisfied. got looking for. wire hassle now. 
 owned item least five years, don't believe i've never reviewed it. one first bluetooth headphones come still believe one best. couple things would consider cons. 1. headphones really heavy ears. becomes painful while. 2. buttons really sensitive. accidentally called hung many people it's ridiculous. hand, love ability listen mp3 player use phone headset. told many people sound incredible compared bluetooth headphones. bass wonderful people hear clearly make call. picks background noise good, however. tried headphones keep coming back these. are, far, best pair owned. 
 reading reviews favorable, pleasantly surprised headset taking advantage really good deal recently. sound quality excellent really impressive bass response. pairing lg vx8700 perhaps makes difference. minor issues though. placing phones properly head mean comfortable time, eventually 2 hours seem pinch. even unbearable. cycled them, music stops answer resumes. jogged them, ear pieces pop rinse necessary. occasionally either phone headset gets confused trying something fast. flipping songs, re-pair device. sound quality pretty good microphone considering distance. slightly muffled, still clear enough limiting factor. cool feature tap right ear piece opens music player phone starts playing. jabra consider putting locking button appropriate location easy inadvertently push one many buttons taking adjusting phones. eventually learn handle avoid this, quirky. would recommend headset looking something pair one newer phones support a2d bluetooth. excellent cycling!update 8/22/07 headset continues operate great, despite dropped numerous times. side note, found riding today pairing lg vx 8700 fouled music intermittent. occasional stumble otherwise smooth streaming, different. ended removing device 8700 re-pairing it. fixed. thing think recently unplugged phone docked usb mode pc supposed without ending via menu first.i use headset run found little floss go along way. yep, tied bit floss ear pieces leaving one side simple knot. floss position across top head pulled ear pieces plastic pieces normally end pinching tops ears tops. double knotted simple knot voila, floss helps support headset running pinching noted original review reduced greatly. actually sitting typing listening petty. great stuff... 
 jabra nothing wrong these. solidly build beautifully designed. paired easily every device i've tried, even work well hands free headset bluetooth cell phone. however, don't work mac, contrary insinuation reviewer, way jabra's fault. bluetooth bluetooth, it's computer manufacturer support "profiles" supported various devices. case mac, apple's bluetooth support incomplete; don't handle advanced audio profile required stereo headsets, headset (or stereo bluetooth headset, matter) work mac apple decides fix this. completely jabra's control, well engineered device. window's xp computer, work well.the negative find headset adjustable thus may fit everybody comfortably. (my wife, example, can't get sit well.) 
 purchased minimal expectations quite impressed. using cell phone sound quality superb. also, using phone calls quite convenient. microphone great sound quality top-notch. even music playing get call automatically pauses music phone call resumes call finished. battery life way longer expected; owned couple months charge twice. buttons headset quite convenient well. would say downside tad bulky somewhat resembling earmuffs. also, depending head size may may fit you; fortunately say fit discomfort stay head even gym. great product! 
 read reviews awesome phone is. but, want bluetooth headset go along it, get plantronics voyager 510. i've tried motorola hs850 h500 & logitech bt headset significant static. i've searched google found people problem phone multiple types headsets. go plantronics voyager 510. little static leave phone one room walk another slight (almost negligable) increase static. problem "answer" button headset answer phone won't automatically connect headset. must first answer phone pushing green button phone press "answer" button headset. . .afterwards, connection seamless. minor inconvenience luxury wireless bt virtually static-free. don't take word it. buy voyager 510 local store easily return you're happy.mp3 ringtones!!!!this phone great making mp3 ringtones. however, change file extension ".mp3" ".3gp". transfering ".3gp" files phone sinch free usb cable pc software. and, want edit mp3 play chorus song ringtone, samsung gives software too!!!! it's included pc studio software comes phone. don't forget change extension ".3gp" . phone allow play mp3 songs (like ipod) won't allow make mp3 songs ringtones unless pay downloading website like t-mobile. . . or, method mentioned above. changing extension 3gp also easy program show full name music file (i.e. check_up_on_it.mp3), like nero burning rom. 
 motorola floundering cell phone market came razr. worldwide, made fashion technological statement, catapulted manufacturer dismal afterthought leader cell phone market. released candy bar equivalent (slvr), improved razr's lines stylish clamshell pebl. review motorola pebl.after using pebl days, first thing impressed sound quality. recently, played sony/ericson, palmone, nokia samsung phones, must say motorola sounds best. first all, volume earpiece loud enough hear walking busy new york city street, cars, trucks buses creating deafening noise. second, volume control button well placed allow easily adjust level. third, best all, phone intelligent enough filter much loud background noise, person you're speaking hear without struggling make you're saying. found nokia good too, palm, samsung sony/ericson phones don't well all, sony ironically back pack. also noteworthy speakerphone. it's loud office phone's speaker, plenty loud, example, participate conference call driving. background noise reduction virtues phone, impressed. also, voice recognition - based solely spelling contacts, phone recognize you're saying able voice-dial.it may seem odd make fuss sound quality age smart phones, designer recently explained me: form follow function. let pebl first foremost good phone. add bells whistles later. attention principle earned pebl five stars me.a note carriers: gsm worldwide, use phone overseas well usa. however, limits states tmobile cingular. used both, feel tmobile sounds better, cingular better coverage. it's tradeoff. carriers offer 7 14 day "trial" period test network's performance. recommend use trial, don't hesitate bounce back forth keeping number.i four major pros pebl:1. motorola pioneering cell phone market making latest models "quad-band" gsm, means phone work well usa (850/1900 mhz) well rest world (900/1800 mhz). gsm phones tri-band (850/1800/1900) they'll work great here, performance abroad touch go, phone performing poorly indoors. none others (nokia, ericson, samsung etc.) offer quad-band gsm standard, motorola's recent offerings, could find quad-band phones massive pda smart phones.2. battery life: cell phones give estimates standby time talk time. realistic factor long thing last charges average person? answer: 3 4 days. moderate use (about 10 calls day, totaling 30 45 minutes), needed charge phone 3rd day.3. usb port: phone's connection world via standard mini-usb port. charger fits this, plug computer standard usb mini-usb cable. cable connects digital cameras certain mp3 players (at least ones don't use overpriced proprietary cables). chances already one cables plug pc, two things happen: phone start charge usb, pc detect new device. download drivers motorola (if didn't get cd phone). addition phone drivers, "phone tools" application lets synchronize contact list calendar outlook, simply backup phone's contents. synchronize photos, ringtones sms messages well. here's best part: phone also modem. make sure data plan connecting internet, longer need hot spot. gprs give little 2x speed dialup, edge take 4x.4. phone alarm built in. fact several, name them, turn phone night, alarm still work, ask want turn phone silence it.other noteworthy items: screen good, camera produces reasonable images videos, enough memory snap 100 shots phone's highest resolution. nice touch.and now, three cons:1. longest time, cared much motorola contact management interface. nearly phones allow multiple numbers / addresses per contact, motorola hasn't caught yet. contact multiple phone numbers, contact exist multiple times. makes dialing slower motorola phones you'll scroll longer contact list; searching numbers nearly intuitive nokia phone brands.2. phone allows assign custom ring tones certain members address book; however, contacts custom ringtone, phone doesn't differentiate calls text messages, contact custom tone sends text, phone might play entire minute-long song rather quick beep beep, annoying middle night. avoid using custom contact/ring tone assignments you'll avoid problem.3. shiny dialing surface screen pick grease face require regular cleaning want avoid phone looking "icky".in conclusion, happily surprised pebl. sexy phone, sounds great. perfect phone audiophile, person wants device works without cope secondary bells whistles phones days. historically, motorola known producing good hardware - virtue clearly stated pebl. intend use fancy features modern cell phones (sms, mms, etc) - words plan use software features, expect less intuitive brands phones. much motorola known producing excellent hardware, menus navigation bewildering times. think get folks designed hardware redesign software interface. then, moto range would dominate. end, it's good phone, it's solid, it's small light enough fit comfortablty pocket, works. 
 phone two months best one owned,i three razr's many called cutting edge phones even v3i none good this,as pebl simple open unless butter fingered fool,and finish wearing keypad well mine fine.the phone made better flimsey razr is,you want quality phone works well looks get phone,you want cheap made buy something else. 
 purchased phone use europe recent trip. loved it. nice form factor, opening requires one hand voice quality great. happy purchase. wish us carrier (verizon) phone! 
 best phone ever owned. reception good, battery life good, ring audible, quality voice good. mine already came ear phone, usb cable, leather case 256mb memory card. things good: - need clean cover frequently (it gets easily smudged); - mp3 sound perfect (well phone mp3 player); - switched gsm card reverted kanji characters hard time find english option ;) 
 really enjoy high quality, that's constant belkin. product reputation repeats, holds up. 
 received item time good condition. retractable cables like one better ones used. perfect storing vehicle charging. mess glove compartment. 
 works advertised cord, normally way, get tangled. genius solution. didn't someone earlier? 
 and, great price too. product works exactly factory cord; and, retractable feature allows easily keep one stored truck instead toting cords back forth house truck. 
 given reviews here, decided getting two batteries would smart due freshness issue, case first one didn't last long. (my original battery worn out.) it's couple months first battery still going strong needed charger finish calls. price major factor compared retail wanted wait months considering new phone. much lower price made plan easier, giving plenty time consider next generation razr. batteries quickly died short-term didn't lose much deal. 
 battery exactly advertised, genuine motorola br50 battery. knock off. such, works exactly way would expect motorola battery work, much less money. 
 we've using 2 batteries ten days problems all. new appearance charge phones 12 hours prior first use. follow review - it's 2 full months since bought batteries still working perfectly. 
 batteries exactly advertised, delivered normal timeframe, issues hiccups drama vendor. "slam, bam, thank you, sirs madams." battery life really subjective everyone's "normal" different. life definitely restored compared original 2 year old battery. experience use bluetooth really drains batteries quickly. that's bluetooth issue goes away don't use bluetooth. complaints product. 
 fits razr like original battery made motorola. worked perfectly second battery days much effort find charger. 
 razr v3 two years wouldn't hold charge. cingular & verizon stores offered replacements batteries cost almost much phone new. $10 bucks replacement gave phone new lease life. exact replacement knockoff. great talk standby time. 
 battery goes 5 year old cell phone available local stores. price right using month w/o problems... 
 looks good easy pair. fits nicely looked described ad, shipping right money. 
 case almost perfect palm treo 700. fit great. leather soft high quality. magnetic closure best i've seen, alignment required yet secure. one exception belt clip. takes three men dog get belt! tight think could tear case getting unless pry something like pen. don't know thinking putting tight clip great case. 
 die hard treo 600 user. best case i've ever owned. already wore exact case 3 year period bought another one. perfect fit antenna treo 600 650. 
 palm oem version fits great looks good. 3 months, issues all. also two small pockets sd cards noted ad. great value, 40% less palm selling for. 
 spent good bit time reading amazon reviews treo cases. cases mixed reviews. palm one treo 700/650 pouch leather case stylish nice soft leather. first treo moved around little case. little movement noticable bothersome. remembered little pocket inside case, put 4 business cards inside. enough keep treo moving. actually pocket can't really hold 4 5 business cards without making difficult close treo case. really like magnetic flap. it's easy open close. finally belt clip holds securely belt. 
 happy headset - thank you!i don't problems complaints. h700 nice upgrade h500. 
 wont find better choice time. switch folding headset easy push buttons make difference world. don't believe me, purchase jabra one headsets, place pocket purse answer call phone. chances forgotten turn unit caller live wherever left bluetooth headset within 30 feet. h700 folds take ear folds, turns off. sounds good reasonably priced effective, simple !! 
 it's lite, comfortable, sound good one i've talked commented phone sounds different. however problem getting pair. go online figure since directions came poor. could get light stop blinking blue purple pair. online directions said close mic, hold button turns purple open mic. that's really correct either. open mic finger holding button down. forgot mention important step. can't tell many times figuring one out. said works well pairing easy getting light turn purple. obviously 5 stars gave i'm recommending it.update: february 11, 2009 bluetooth slowly died. people longer able hear me. said sounded like miles away. took good car unit, always kept case worn maybe two hours day average. tried cleaning mic didn't help. lasted year half guess got moneys worth. thought you'd like know. 
 i've paired mine razr v3 black razr v3i without issues. sound perfect, static interference. callers end hear clearly vice versa. lightweight portable cannot recommend enough!the thing want mention purchased back, getting started guide outdated gave older sequence steps pairing device, frustrating beginning realized instructions wrong. went online motorola got proper set instructions, voila, perfect!

 like convenience blue tooth wireless, family keeps coming back top quality wired headset sound quality. use much wear out, use periodically travel mobile phones, also portable home phones. know going wind use headset instead wireless - comparison use plantronics voyager pro plus great wireless headset, real sound quality ends can't beat plantronics mx500 series. hope keep around while. 
 (broke them, totally fault) use adapter android phone. sensitive clients calls press people hearing clearly, easily consistently. take headset sister 3-in-1 version day several bluetooth headsets purchased years. know older product, works extremely well. made titanium, would buy almost price trashed (again, fault, dog ate one, crushed other) two them. thankfully inexpensive. 
 bought plantronics bluetooth headsetplantronics voyager 510 bluetooth headsetfor car extremely happy it. wanted leave car, though, knew took got out, would never remember put back car. decided get wired headset keep briefcase because, despite technically literate, i'm still leary something emitting radio waves stuck ear day. mx505 great. importantly, it's durable. also good sound quality people call trouble hearing me. 
 c139 cheapest model tracfone's lineup. it's good basic phone gives good voice clarity easy text messaging. tracfone doesn't lot services offer (which isn't bad thing people want basic cellular service), phone doesn't give music downloads live tv (which carriers mostly misleading hype anyway). color screen small good-quality. thing don't like tracfone's 60-day refill polic: must refill every 60 days keep account active; otherwise forfeit number balance. prepaid providers like speak wireless (from 7-eleven) give one full year usage. 
 bought phone sick sprint's contracts. great following reasons:- cheap ($13)- superb coverage: travel coast coast even get service backwoods rural alabama (costa rica too)- battery lasts lasts (and lasts)- easy useall wanted phone worked. previously owning $700 mini-computer type phone ready kick 'em curb great. you're tired high charges contract hassles, give try. spent $100 1200 minutes year's worth service.the caveat service get dinged entire minute even used 2 seconds it. good stuff have, little detail doesn't bother bit! 
 great product. works like name brand product. haven't problem product. price allot better name brand one. pay name product like this. would recommend product everyone. 
 received great time brought store.very basic job.thanks,

 works really good. dont even worry cant charge phone house. love item easy carry anywhere go. 
 dry bag works well. several close wrapping top several times. closure uses rotating tabs lock bag shut. great way seal bag. tested receiving it. passed flying colors. 
 went cruise, wanted something waterproof cell phone wallet contents beach activities stuff might get wet. little number fit bill quite well. durable plastic, clever latches work well seal top. leak tested leaving, impressed seal. went snorkelling free lockers use, didn't actually use water, would felt safe lockers weren't available. like canoe summer, much convenient cell phones, etc, larger dry bag using. wife impressed enough mine wants one summertime. recommend! 
 used go water park. didnt swimming walked lot sprinklers. phone fine could use touch screen case. 
 wish backside clear could access camera phone. otherwise says. 
 it's job well. smart phone fits & use plastic. took fishing & worked like charm. think it's well worth money. 
 i've fallen water kayaking times ipod touch lg xenon cases. they've submerged water minutes survived. haven't issues humidity inside pack, i'm heavy user cell phone touch paddling. 
 important drop remote control lake due high cost replacement. case exactly right size since clear front remote operated without opening case winner 
 good practice bag, regular quality, work well, price, product company offer satisfaction purchase 
 fishing i'd used identical &#34;brand name&#34; dry pak loaned friend. kwik tek is, said identical, good bit cheaper. waterproof mudproof protection iphone i've used fishing working outside damp, muddy conditions. padding provides additional protection drops bumps. float devices, especially leave air inside. except camera, phone apps fully functional although prefer remove talking. lanyard provides bit extra security haven't yet needed kayaking. uses assure inside totally dry, good idea prop open air drop one silica packs. guess could get protection baggie, low price kwik tek cheap insurance phone priceless data. 
 buying $400 cell phone pocket wasn't going take chances it. pouch saved phone's life! attached pouch mountain bike large rubberized bands (made purpose) stretch wrap around bars loops end stretch around phone.i unexpectedly sank tipped small stream phone bike became caked mud. washed case river phone fine inside. pouch become coveted fellow mountain bikers without protection... phones. 
 tried ordering blackberry battery line turned fake knockoff. fake knockoff. works great. 
 made decision early year pick newblackberry curve 8330as better method communicating clients family. seen reviews averaged 4.4 5, seemed decent choice. turned one best decisions made year, blackberry turned far better expected... faster previous phone, reliable, versatile rugged, dropped calls. phone one simple problem: it's battery eater!went cell phone provider see getting extra battery, surprised find standard 1000 mah oem lithium ion battery cost almost $45.00. seemed bit steep, began searching amazon.com found blackberry li-ion [oem] c-s2 battery. cautious extreme price difference, figured truly oem c-s2 battery, worth gamble.examined arrived, found original blackberry logo, marked c-s2 face, correct version phone (and many blackberry models). back listed lithium ion battery, 3.7v, capacity 1150mah 4.3wh... identical original battery. charged overnight, done phone first received original battery.it good choice, battery perfect backup original. function original c-s2 battery, seems difference. went buy second backup, seemed good idea "better safe sorry" situations. must admit use built-in gps quite bit, along frequent 'net access, probably accounts need extra battery power. might note picked anexternal battery charger blackberry 8300 8320 8330, perfect compliment batteries.one might note prices blackberry c-s2 oem batteries seem vary quite bit here, seem come well $7.00... far less cell phone retailers charging. searching amazon.com you'll find excellent prices these.if battery seems last long original specs blackberry stated, argue retailer... waste far less time get one c-s2 oem batteries here. giving 5-star rating without hesitation all. 
 great battery super price. cannot compare higher rated &lt;life> batteries. works great original spec. get days worth use easy. keep charged. 
 battery perfect blackberry 8700, long standby time quick charge, eforcity's delivery speedy too. 
 price good cable working well. good experience cable. 
 single glitch. fair priced fast shipping. problems hassles connecting syncing using windows xp vista. what's love? 
 like tablet case keyboard wire keyboard sticking case. easy way get caught something damage. works great keep wire keyboard inside area case protected. 
 exactly it's supposed do: allow plug mini-usb plug place couldn't fit angle. 
 device small attachment navigon 2100, 5100 7100 series gps.for reason, navigon decided place charger receptacle bottom (facing downwards) units. makes little difference use windshield suction cup hold display unit. however, use adhesive disc dash charger cord likely bent right angles make connection, receptacle gps points straight down. device, attached gps, allows allows charger cord come side, eliminating acute bending cord.conclusion:a helpful device navigon gps units; intend users wish unit mounted dash. 5 stars 
 using keep garmin nuvi 360 powered driving. didn't know got it, garmin plugged using battery power, automatically turns car turned (that's get reading instruction manual, lol).to cleaner appearance car, mini-usb plugged ball mount holding gps plugged gps itself. unfortunately, port really close ball mount restricts it's movement plugged in. adapter, makes cable less intrusive makes gps free adjust ball mount nearly position desired. combination 1.50 mini-usb cable, probably cheapest way keep nuvi charged driving!! 
 needed, run cord gps mounted car. trigger garmin go usb pc-connected mode, like usb right angle cords do. 
 thought help good look two devices important last need modify mini usb easy cable one small pcb inside giving room add resistor. thank seller. 
 love able use phone mp3 player. neat hear person talking stereo. love product. well worth money. 
 think pretty good headphones compared older set logitech bluetooth headphones. ones much comfortable longer time don't seem fragile. love there's built-in microphone voice. i've used phone people may give strange looks talking person phone seemed hear fine.i think also great use cable often gets way. enjoy using i'm taking bike ride. adapter ipod use these. complaint go gym on. hear music fine volume up, however i'm watching show ipod often times can't hear much dialogue. situations end using ear buds. i'd say sound quality alright. i'm audiophile usually good ear sound quality. battery life seems good like charge standard mini-usb connection.i've 1 problem that's probably worth sharing. pairing headphones different devices sometimes issue wouldn't pair anything. i'd shut off, plug pc powered on. seconds i'd disconnect tried pair would work. sure cause didn't try plugging regular power source see fixes it. warning come across problem too. doesn't happen every time isn't deal breaker me. 
 love it, bought at&t store first came almost $140.00, see great price here. pairs easily excellent sound quality (and i'm extremely picky comes quality sound). want buy extra set case anything ever happens these. charge fast work great. problem ever without case, accidently turn way easy need them, battery dead. button right ear pushes easy turn unit expecially handle move them. always sure light blinking you'll drain battery, whose charging connector comes standard small usb connector found phones headsets today. comes charger black protective cover bit small, fighting get bag cause accidently turn on.

 phone every thing could want phone. even makes calls ;-) camera takes nice picture video, large display shows clearly. make ring tones mp3s, though limited size, enough good long ring. (it would go voice mail song would repeat.) mp3 player cheesy, plays fine (no higher 192 bit rate) added 1 gig microsd, able convert music videos even full length divx'd movies phone. (use super, must awesome free video audio conversion (not plug, truth)) blue tooth works great, combined free samsung edit software, full control phone content pc. design sleek, fits pocket ease. could go on.. liked much got second one wife.the but....the ear piece volume low. max setting 5. really needs go 10. "whine" i'd careful sliding open take call, easily tap 'end call' button send strait voice mail.the pros really weigh cons far, i'd get 80 usd price need :)

 ive tried many blu tooth head sets none worked looking wired head set cell phone uses adapter didnt like thought would try wep 200, worked great kept falling ear, even wore swimming pool forgot on, dried kept working.late spring finally fell ear yard lost it. fall neighbor kids play large yard found it. covered dirt survived mowings twice week sprinkler system every day, thunderstorms damp outdoors 3 months.to make long story short, i'm still using it, right now. solved problem falling purchasing ear hooks it, cheap bought several really work.samsung wep180 / wep200 / wep210 bluetooth headset hook [oem] aaet180sbebstd 
 bluetooth small discrete yet picks voice perfectly. highy recommend it! 
 samsung wep200 works perfectly treo 700p. easy set up. charger/case cool. small protects headset. sounds really great compared headsets. nice loud even driving radio on. callers end notice using headset. would definitely recommend headset. 
 owned 2 best bluetooth used. like much better wep400 currently using. gave one friend girl got wep400. wish would given away wep400 instead. great product. fell ear once. go ahead get one regret it. 
 great little item. stress 'little' part. won't feel like borg ear. matter fact, won't even realize there. one thing would recommend. get little attachment loop ear. available samsung 5.95 believe. without it, extremely hard time keeping headset ear. and, small light, may even realize fallen out. drive crazy without piece. don't understand included headset - necessary. looked expensive ones. see reason pay big bucks. get it! 
 far best headset i've used. performance & comfort, i've found anything better yet. you're looking current motorola headsets, stop look further. unit worked equally well moto q & samsung u740.pros:1. ear design(no hook) - always hated wear hook ear gets way wear sunglasses2. like fact hard case protection use doubles charger base.3. probably one smallest lightest i've use.cons:1. haven't really found yet.** make sure don't buy fake ones ebay/else where. tax/shipping, amazon price still one best price there. 
 recently bought fourth wep200. great headset. everyone i've bought loves its. small, discrete stays ear. takes bit figure put ear. in, stays in. easy connect phones: lgvx9700, lgvx9400, samsung sch-a950, samsung u550, lgvx8500. great buy. bought 1 4.99 20 mir. 
 bought one along expensive plantronics voyager 510 bluetooth headset, opinion, wep200 good plantronic one, better. 
 one best headsets ive ever owned..you get jabra eargels ..i shook head harder stayed snug. shoots samsung great product... 
 without doubt _loudest_ bluetooth headset i've ever used. even friend mine mumbles constantly phone i've never use 50% volume. i've tried four different phones work great them. sound quality top notch too.tip:try different tips, try ears. 
 bluetooth headset tiny compared others i've researched. purchased daughter, loves it. paired easily env2 verizon phone. called test could hear clearly reports hear well too. feedback noise echo. reports comfortable, wearing long periods time without problem. standby time 70 hours, doesn't constantly charging. great product. 
 expected small earphone based reviews still surprised it's tiny size first looking close.medium ear "hook" worked - suggest playing (removing rubber hook adjusting ear piece) getting right fit - bud goes ear added loop rubber supposed counter curve another part outer ear - genius design imho thing in, even jumping shaking head tapping head (yes tried too, silly know...) dislodge this.paired easily samsung ach930, sound great side call also impressed, complaints echo static.have plantronics 510 good, wep200 smaller yet compares quality plantronics. 
 love clear sounds crazy like everyone else hook deal price seen sprint 49.95 deal!clear static thing problem volume put people mute ( prob bluetooth) 
 $20 paid it, satisfied. size great barely noticeable ear. battery life also great. 
 say get great product steal price ($5 assuming get $20 mail rebate). voice quality good, connectivity easy well. product delivers it's intended for. 
 first thing noticed samsung wep200 first connected treo 750 fast connected great quality was.i owned many bluetooth headsets unusable static would connect device timely fashion even connect unit standby long periods time.the wep200 connects quickly sound quality superb.people end can't even tell bluetooth headset.the earpiece fits ear snugly fairly comfortable hours gets bit sore side. wish sort necklace dongle could placed taken needed.its small light range excellent.very highly recommended. 
 one dog got hold it, bought another one like replace it. love size, sounds great couldn't happier it. highly recommend anyone! 
 purchased pouch lost two headsets had. pouch arrived said would. happy service received. would buy again. 
 small, cute clip could hurt someone with. yes, h500 headset fits well retaining strap velcro make sure stays there.motorola blt-04 bluetooth headset carrying case 
 absolutely best essential accessory bluetooth wireless headset. love death!!! thanks amazon. 
 basic thrills case bluetooth headset. imho need something put bluetooth into, is. stretches out, front back hard, elastic holds sides together velcro close top stretches over. back metal clamp clip onto belt such. 
 great idea! cases phones one bluetooth. motorola hs850 earpiece wanted make sure would lose misplace it. holder clips car visor purse handy. fits earpiece perfectly. got one husband brother bluetooth. can't beat quality price. definitely recommend anyone earpiece constantly misplacing it. 
 second blutooth earpiece ever owned. never feels like fall ear doesn't hurt wear several hours.the sound clear one end ever heard echo feed back. use lg chocolate cellphone. would buy gift others. price right great value. 
 sounds good end.took long time earpiece soften maybe ear confored it.buggy. reset while. 1st call sometimes dumps.good noise control transmit. steady noise eliminated music voices still cause interference. use 18 wheller. one bluetooth used there. few. thats put bugyness. 
 11th different bluetooth headset i've tried past year it's best, far, ones i've tried. best could be....not long shot works goes long way.i use business calls yet called it. within self makes winner gennum nxzen almost works good. difference hear one relative ease opposed nxzen. boost microphone (on nxzen)gain decreases audio issue. prefer "in-the-ear" type headset i'm always using loud places like airports etc. built boom slides forward provides excellent audio receiver. still, struggle times, hearing caller. talk time, far, good. wear several hours point ear start hurting.i use treo 700w. drops pairing semi-regular basis. easy pair original phone i've able pair thing.overall, waiting wait more. it's worth price. 
 nice stylist product. using treo 700p. crystal clear sound quality different volument levels suit (use hearing aids). long lasting battery time. charge weekends only.cons: occasional loss bluetooth communication phone headset. 
 it's years since bluetooth headset, many i've used, far favorite. could listen streaming music phone stayed ear really well. headset i've people could actually hear time. sliding boom mic made big difference.the downfall model, reviewers also written, rubber tips hold headset ear break time. used superglue prolonged life mine while, annoying. 
 nice looking piece works well. voice quality excellent, people i've called report sometimes slight buzzing talking them, although still hear well. battery life excellent charges fast. comfortable lightweight, glad didn't pay more, one fine everyday casual use.

 bought expensive outter case get one surprised one feels better galaxy note. course would recommend, specially doesn't want expend lot money case. 
 reviews stating.....this excellent case note! openings exactly right, easy turn screen button upper right phone, stylus comes easy, able charge use cameras. one reviewer stated secure screen protector - case enough over-lap secure. screen touch surface. boxwave shipped arrived time excellent condition. 
 item described. saved phone knocked bath 6 yo son. attractive good purchase. would order again.recommended. 
 case pretty slim yet protects phone elements. also case great phone turned screen side screen actually hit surface case lip extends past, feature like. it's ease peace mind know equipment well protected. 
 fits well at&t galaxy note. holes might little microphone big deal. dropped phone gave cushion fall. thank god.. 
 got international galaxy note n7000 fits great. would recommend buying screen protector well. works great protect phone looks great well.my phone white makes case look like lighter blue, think it's really pretty color love it. it's see put fortunes fortune cookies show back fun.but warned product picture "blue" galaxy note phone, white one case appear lighter color. 
 got case bought gnote must say looked sexy great! got leather case replace it! price quality great, looks even better! 
 fit verizon version samsung note ii. made classic mistake reading description. thought &#34;international version&#34; meant would fit phones nations -- dummy, me!i searched, again, cannot find fit verizon version design. may released later. hand, cover feels great hand. can't use it. 
 say, bought wife's note back. cheap fits well without added bulk. grippy sides really helped holding larger device loves most. ports open power volume buttons, though covered, function perfectly.if want simple, affordable skin protect bumps bruises without much added bulk, price large starbucks latte' can't beat one! 
 fits note perfectly. great cover protection without adding bulk phone. nice back design also. looks like quality material used. 
 purchased case note suprised nice case price. would highly recommend anyone looking nice cheap case. 
 case made firmer material silicone cases, perfect doesn't stretch get caught going pocket case. hugs phone tight enough many people won't know case it. first thought case making button use difficult, took case realized galaxy note buttons terrible even without case. it's much difficult case on, get used it. textured grip area sides nice tough well. 
 owned many phones years lot expensive cases.this far best case come across. add bulk phone pure comfort holding hand speechless. embossed sides , nice rubbery feel gives good comfort it's dust magnet.i ordered case one protect corners phone dropped. definitely keep brand mind future. it's good definitely recommend anyone wants good protection, comfort style. thank boxwave... 
 great case, fits perfect. holes align correctly buttons, mic's micro usb galaxy note. definitely recommend anyone wanting additional protection low cost. 
 great body case provide good protection adding bulk, easy put fit perfectly highly recommended. 
 like reviews, case great! really like lip it'll protect screen set way. it's flexible like gel kind, looks great. 
 i'm using case at&t version note. gets 5 stars high quality/price ratio. material soft flexible, cut-outs line ok... perfect, don't cause functionality issues. love textured hand grips sides. hard buttons require little pressure push, prefer covered open, recessed case. s-pen opening fine case, problem getting out. make note feel noticeably heavier naked phone, lot area cover note. it's perfect case, i've paid $30 cases "idevices" similar issues. boxwave shipped pretty quickly, tracking available. 
 pros:+ cheap!+ inexpensive+ works greawtcons- didn't get waste $30 piece plastic protect phonea previous discriminating iphone user.... love saving money 
 pros -- cheap- protects phone types mishaps (straight drop corner phone, walking/running phone goes unintended "slide" concrete)- increase bulk phone considerably it's relatively light weight- makes buttons difficult press less accidental presses rocker power key (some may like do)- easy remove replace (great people battery swaps instead wall/car-charging day)- increased grip reduces chance phone leave hand unintentionallycons -i don't care "wave" effect back would prefer all-matte finish opposed combination matte/gloss finishoverall, product exactly it's supposed added benefits like button protection (most cases leave buttons exposed) makes less likely accidentally press them. also, case wraps front screen protrudes 1/16" beyond glass protects screen phone accidentally slid across floor it's dropped flat glass. gripe aesthetic one that's subjective... don't think galaxy note owners critical aesthetics. hopefully company makes one soon-to-be-released note 2 i'll getting one it's released. 
 highly recommend case samsung galaxy note. international unlocked version note, fits perfectly. it's durable gives peace mind phone isn't going slip hands. love knurled edges make easy grip. case also slim, hardly know it's even there. case makes power button harder press, getting used it. 3 different style usb cables, none could seat entirely socket case (the cables would work allow connect/charge phone, bumped anything, cable would fall out). ended using dremel rotary tool slightly enlarge opening case around usb port, cables seat properly. minor quibbles, though. love case. 
 love skin, it's slim light, protects phone well! dropped already times, phone survived problems, still looks like brand new! 
 case fits great, looks good, provides good protection. sufficiently thick elastic cushion fall without making phone much bigger. style case looking for, can't get better case. phone also easy enough remove switch another case easily. 
 love it. 1 year still condition. good hand. usable &#34;standby mode&#34; plastic bracket (of course, could strong would pay it). 
 paired easily treo. sound quality perfect. one complained sound quality end, like motorolla. it's comfortable light. battery life good. totally happy it. 
 excellent product, works well, especially bt phones strong bt signal. connect next room wall good enough phone, without crackling. excellent battery quality. need small ear comfortable fit. 
 you've reviewing bluetooth headsets, you've probably heard all. don't fit ear, echo, callers can't undertand you, battery dies quickly... purchased item month ago, haven't found complaints hold true headset.i've charged once, haven't re-charge yet. sure, i've made 5 6 short calls it, it's turned least hour day commute.my wife could tell calling car, didn't notice difference normal road noise bluetooth reception.the headset fits ear comfortably. probably already read set doesn't insert ear canal, rather rests it. found comfortable, without side-effects. it's even comfortable wearing sunglasses.i've never heard echo, received complaints others hearing one.many reviewers models seem dislike multi-function button. well, it's single button, it's used perform multiple functions. sometimes press seconds, sometimes tap it. primarily use 'on' 'off'. 'on' takes 2 seconds, 'off' takes 5 6 seconds (although admit, seems take bit longer i'd prefer...) turn off. i'm sure would complain feature, phones one...i'm sure fuss reviewers (more often brands...), headset seems perfect me. 
 husband. said trouble connections know product, time using parties connection. would probably buy though design way fit. 
 overall headset one best owned, quite few. 3 different jabras, motorola, another plantronics, various brands. headset clear since fits directly ear, loud enough. pairing snap. currently using new samsung a990.the gripe, isn't really anything serious this. wear headset right ear. driving night, blinking device extremely bright. see cabin vehicle. 
 great product, cofortable easy setup. it's features wonderful battery charger included recharge device anywhere anytime. 
 plantronics world leader ear-piece peripherals. manufacture every imaginable headsets telephone gaming. explorer 330 fits bill supplement bluetooth cellphone ease use functionality way superior lot bluetooth headphones there. mine 2 years always worked great. pairing problem headset, pairing recorded phone, quirks pairing need use it. distance-wise, conform 33ft maximum, personal note, hardly part headset phone distance hardly matters according intended use. overall happy headset exceeded expectations great lengths! 
 plantronics makes best bluetooth headsets get cost. contest. made mistake purchasing jawbone, sennheiser, blueparrot, motorolla, blue trek, god knows others. plantronics brand i've purchased 1 of. many brands cost well 4 5 times one does, none compare battery life, consistency connection, around value. headset take getting used rubber boot slightly penetrates ear, days forget wearing it. headset i've found easier hear sennheiser, likes stop communicating phone til re-pair costs 6 times does.background noise suppression stereotypical, there's noise, person end likely hear translation it. mic sensitive found jawbone, something productive like washing dishes won't blow eardrum whoever speaking with, hear level noise(the jawbone brutally painful that!). think 5th maybe 6th plantronics i've bought, i'm sure won't last.on side note, battery, constant daily use, last approximately 500 charges, 1.5 years avg. typical bluetooth headsets. cost less $20, means unit cost barely $1 per month, opposed $10-15 per month designer headsets! 
 go comfort comes headsets. plantronics headset comfortable headset i've ever owned, always buy plantronics. got one sister loves too. i'm getting ready buy plantronics pro plus headset, use old plantronics back-up. 
 bought first bluetooth-enabled phone 3 years ago deal included motorola bluetooth headset. cool, thought. used less less, thing recharged home would last hour. soon thought hard use ... hard put on, totally weird turn take ear, flip mouthpiece, put back ear. whoever designed thing clue people use headsets. also sounded like talking bottom water well. whenever used conference calls people would yell go mute. started asking people waiting rooms airports brand brand liked. got many people hated jabra didn't even consider it. already didn't really care motorola, started looking nokia, seem nice clumsy, kept meeting people love plantronics. used plantronics headsets long time office, all, that's seem well. looked plantronics didn't find one jumped me, one day ran across explorer 350. good true! kidding me, $49 bucks bluetooth headset made top brand? looked closer found plantronics something unique headset. instead charge home, comes extremely cool little clip either mounts dash hooks air vent car plugs cigarette lighter. made sense! place hold headset use most, always charging, ready use second walk around rest day fully charged. us road warriors, plantronics also thoughtfully included usb charging cable trusty laptop keep headset charged sleep. buy optional ac adapter makes feel secure. built perform? built like hummer! main piece one solid chunk looks like pretty immune normal damage clunking around pocket lot coins. piece goes around ear looks like solid well, effortlessly switches ear ear slips one easy motion. first time, thing slips thought part instantly perfect position use. operation couldn't simpler. unlike motorola several switches remember sequence push in, plantronics one switch. push turn on, push turn off, push talk, push hang up, push voice dial, etc. push. want make louder quieter? push push down. no-brainer. saved performance last convinced keep it. quick charge called friend car window rolled down. friend talk time land line. said, hey, bought new bluetooth headset want see sounds you. said, cool, put i'll let know. said ... already on! said sound perfect, background noise kind sounded least good landline. one things several airport buddies told liked plantronics durable rubber earpiece fits comfortably inside ear blocks noise ... like annoying flight announcements. say sound perfect friend every call easier hear headset ever tried.pros:sound qualitysuperior constructionease usepairing - instant flawlesspricecomfortcons:none could see. earns comfortable 5 stars! 
 various brands bluetooth headsets i've purchased, plantronics products seem offer best value dollar. purchased headsets sennheiser, blueant, trek, jawbone, pioneer, sony, motorola, god knows else. plantronics brand i've repeat customer of. i've gotten sound quality $20something headset $140+ jawbone $160+ sennheiser! advice, simple, order plantronics headset, take change get new games apps fancy android handset... 
 tried way many bluetooth headsets (motorola, plantronics, io gear, logitech, jabra) found disappointing. imho, scala 700 right best bang buck. second product cardo scala - first 500, also great headset. 500 great sound ends loud enough. headsets suffer earpiece volume loud enough. also lack noise cancellation wind noise reduction headsets made useful office quiet car. scala 700 windguard technology perfect - performs much better anything else tried. 700 1/3 smaller 500 performs well every aspect. buttons controls easy use intuitive. takes little tweaking adjust headset comfortable fit, bending shaping earpiece, headset stable comfortable. price, good option. 
 bought treo 650 far i'm impressed. battery life great (about 10 hours), charges quickly, it's literally light forget you're wearing it. also appreciate addition pc usb charge cable travelling lighter. nice addition price.i've week holding well (you get padded velcro carrying case too) initial impression, honest, seemed little fragile - it's small light. i've skeptical we'll see goes return i'll modify review.pairing treo 650 fast simple. rings 1 second phone rings also. volume control unit easy use turned loud. complaints sound quality anyone - wife says sounds little like i'm speakerphone it's clear understandable.update: chance hear wife using headset finally i'm impressed - think headset keeper. there's virtually background noise. couldn't even tell driving car. absolutely amazing background noise cancellation.update #2: battery lasts forever - impressed - really forget you're wearing thing - it's small light! 
 i've tried motorola hs810 treo bluetooth headsets, far best one. problem motorola doesn't synch treo 650 100% time; treo headset poor volume (i need quiet room hear anything). cardo scala 700 great fit (it sits right ear canal), great volume (even driving windows down), synchs treo 650 time. headset i'd recommend anyone treo 650. 
 concerned ordering device, read many reviews said device cheap piece plastic didn't fit ear properly. opened packaged first put ear, thought "oh - right!"but read manual adjusting "ear loop" angling headset slightly downward, fit perfectly ear! it's snug, doesn't flop around all. fits different way traditional "ear plug" device many ways it's comfortable it's sitting outer ear canal slightly outside.so you're thinking ordering device, i'd recommend buying it. spend little time getting fit right read manual adjust ear loop makes huge difference.(functionally product paired cingular hermes 8525 phone perfectly - sound quality fine). 
 outstanding headset. best ever used. syncs perfectly treo 650. one press call button locks onto treo bluetooth operation. even use second one home 5.8 ghz cordless phones bta ii scala bluetooth adapter. 
 can't even begin tell hell i've bt headsets treo 650. pairing issues - either won't pair phone don't stay paired. volume loud enough. returned least 5 headsets came across one. sound quality maybe 8 10 volume unbelievable, coming guy doesn't best hearing. actually hear person line - time. even noisy environments. complaints people receiving end except i'm home mircowave oven running (this scramble almost bt frequencies). buttons placed well responsive.initial pairing breeze 700 connects phone flawlessly virtually every call. two weeks i've owned it, think failed connect two occasions make well 50 calls/day. compares 75% connect rate realized bt headsets.battery life 10 10. charge headset every day often talk 5-6 hours one day without recharging. amazing! claim 10 hours (which may actually achieve) i'm amazed actually make past 5 hours.the range great can't fault headset treo known incorporate substandard bt electronics phones - make range very, poor. while, phone right pocket headset left ear, slight crackling noise. it's bad though, annoying. pulling pocket immediately relieves problem.whatever do, don't attempt test buzzer feature headset ear - buzzing loud it's placed right ear. needed find lost room, prepared make room quiet locate it. relies internal speaker create buzzing sound.nice two chargers available retail packaging (one standard wall outlet adapter one usb charger). carrying case useless nice add nonetheless.i would recommend anyone treo 650. i'm sure headset rate well phones guarantee won't find better bt headset 650. 
 purchased laptop defective headphone jack & use ipod's bluetooth adapter (wrevo a100). software update laptop's adapter could happier purchase. soon turn laptop, headphones connect. sound quality great easily walk 15-20 feet away line sight experience distortion. go another room, drop off, reconnects line sight re-established.with ipod bluetooth adapter, features work: volume control, play/pause & song forward/backward. worth noting forward/backward track function work itunes.they get slightly uncomfortable 4 hours straight wear, 15 minutes rest, i'm good go another several hours.i tried headset phone, don't use that, review microphone.i would use jogging exercise due would feel bouncing ears, stay really well mow lawn yard work 2-3 hours. 
 found wife pregnant, instantly looked acquire set headphones could use disturb sleeping baby. already purchased themotorola motorokr s9 bluetooth stereo headphones, didn't work well laying down, didn't great blocking outside noises. also thesony mdr-rf925rk 900 mhz analog rf wireless headphone, good canceling outside noises, produced much static whitenoise useless.when came across s805 went ahead gave try. i'm glad did. first, note would never use make phone calls. can, big bulky wouldn't even try. walking around house giant beasts isn't idea good bluetooth talking device. use watch movies/anime play ps3.they hooked yamaha htr-5640 home theater receiver using asony bluetooth transmitter adapter ipod mp3 players. unless receiver bluetooth built in, you'll need transmitter. sure supports a2dp. thejabra bluetooth music adaptor, didn't work s805 wasn't a2dp compliant.overall, love quality connection: whitenoise, static. occasional dropped signal, that's easily quickly restored. purchased december 2008, march 2011 still work like charm. 
 first pair bluetooth headphones, opted style want set headphones phone truly deliver music quality sound i'm looking for, want come pair headphones feel like they're worth money paid them. headphones easily fulfill desires me, some!these motorola headphones lightweight, also won't feeling overly weighed down, either. they're simply solid-feeling weight construction. read many reviews online, one owner owned headphones course least year half, paid $120.00 pair. considering price got (comparable prices found amazon), feel like got mine steal, less $40.00!these motorola headphones feel like they're worth $150.00, stereo sound comes great. sound crisp, clear, plenty depth taste. didn't find headphones lacking production bass. no, bass isn't going blow eardrums out, like sound elements enhance overall effect music, overpower it.as far taking calls go, obvious microphone these, work great, same. callers problems whatsoever hearing these, could hear beautifully well. told audio received loud, crisp, clear, seemed case well end calls. i've also trouble using operational buttons, phone found paired headphones easily. thing didn't remember ordered these, though (completely fault), won't able wear take calls i'm driving, traffic laws dictate ears cannot covered obstruct vital traffic sounds. oh well. bad.overall, thrilled headphones. always found single-ear bluetooth headsets look little ridiculous, eager get stereo set bluetooth headphones didn't look odd awkward. headphones large, they're solidly made, look like expensive, high quality piece audio equipment. love them, would buy heartbeat. 
 plugged worked. works every time. great buy quality good.

 nokia oem car charger. better off-brand charger.it charges nokia phone car.for money can't go wrong. 
 careful, high output charger, battery charges quickly, also heats up. charger solidly built, rattles feels like survive repeated plugging unplugging. bright, easy see led know plugged properly. 
 worth use it. however, don't like cell power traveling:) 
 good charger. works well. helpful use a-gps phone (which eats battery life pretty quickly). 
 money spent it, good deal.it useful car, mobile low battery. course, take time charge, nevertheless, useful. 
 excelente... gusto mucho el adaptador nokia dc-4 cargador de m&oacute;vil... antes de comprarlo verifiquen si sus nokias funcionan con este cargador, ya que otros modelos requieren el dc-6 que la entrada es diferente... 




 soon plugged charger wall made spark. thank god didn't blow something could've happened phone. charger dead! 
 worked (past tense) good (not perfect, good enough deserve a-)the buttons great. comfort good. sound good enough get workouts (i'm sound pro).at 6 month mark, device kept beeping holding volume key. yes, turned & on, reset etc. turned left alone hours. stopped little (about 20 min) started again. every time used after, would start beeping incessantly short unknown time interval.when read reviews item, take note long person owned device. p90x workouts, frequently sweat quite bit. wipe device finished. item never submerged, etc. device, books, sweat proof 6 months.judging reviews s10-hd, it's undesirable product. people owned s9 went s10 said worse almost ways. based experience motorola support device, want nothing products.support pretty bad. attempted online thought making headway.the rep chat ended telling they'd emailing directions mail (after attaching receipt chat).an email arrive requesting receipt again. replied gave receipt. response them.emailed another response receipt attached. response.did another online chat jumped hoops questioning again. end rep told call motorola, gave phone case number.called them. hold quite long time, talked agent (who put hold times) said they'd emailing directions sending in. that's is.it's taking hours resolve something could resolved 10-30 minutes.why can't resolve one agent, one session? 
 headset mic sound quality average however price it's bad deal. 
 i'd give 0 stars could - arrived dead - plug make lot scratching sounds, sound comes people can't hear (mic issue too).can't recommend. 
 palm dies licked wounds dies palm, don't think phone compary tried this, even though cool concept. damn cover would always peel months good gone ! 
 didn't work. tried tired tired get work luck. dont waist money. 
 charger dock requires additional pieces order function...not sure i'll ever use it. consider required replacement back pixi cheap fails meet quality phone. 
 purchased charging dock, went throught receiving wrong product wait receive correct item later date. said done, dock work. half mind think seller sent faulty dock complained receiving incorrect propduct begin with. really frustrated point. going bother complaining again, gotten nowhere. ugh!! hope seller enjoys donation... 
 got sgs3. picked samsung back cover e bay....this works fine it, phone(with case on) barely stays place. get right start charging touchy...u move slightest, stops working. sloped design thing makes difficult flat surface.o, mention won't work even slim rubber case phone. case:greatshield guardian series slim-fit s-line design tpu case samsung galaxy s3 - blackmight well plug phone go hassle removing case.i assumed would come cable wall plug need actually use it....but no...this dock only! (the seller since added info title listing)you must micro usb cable thin head, "tunnel" back dock cord goes narrow. lucky, one older samsung phones cable small enough....and usb charger....but indicator lights dock...i found much better solution:qi wireless charger receiver pad samsung galaxy s3 s9300nokia dt-900 wireless charging plate - retail packaging - redi confirm 2 products work perfectly slim case phone. nokia pad tad smaller s3, sit much better palm touchstone. 
 plugged work. bother trying figure shipment broken (i.e., stone back). i'm sure would great worked. 
 got thing saw heavily advertised solid protection phone's glass. used must say better one two dollar protectors. wrinkled, filled bubbles gets dirty easily. despite repeated efforts remove them, thing bubbles bubble bath. would recommend it, plus it's pricey! 
 don't waste money "lifetime replacement" get beeter protectors lot cheap prices. screen protectors usually last life phone anyway. 
 concept great tad heavy ears, would stay on. also, work w/ iphone-my ears almost blasted tried them. am, frankly, shocked s/e would make cool headset work w/ many phones, especially iphone. may work well devices...i cannot determine possibility. 
 nice looking, small light weight.average sound over-priced.you cannot adjust volume ipod touch iphone. big, big minus.i recommend item. better choices there. 
 antenna work virgin mobile wifi, even though says work cellular networks. virgin mobile device antenna outputs sierra wireless, external antenna supported. thing use cradle sell, far able find out.i paid exorbitant amount shipping seller ended returning pay shipping. lost $$ deal didn't work. sticking amazon prime everything on. 
 dont know happened mine got crack plastic disinegrated 6 hours use sun. also uncomfortable, ears hurt day afterwards wearing long. 
 product claimed charger iphone 3gs. however compatible phone, work all! 
 price great delivery o.k. everything adequate. one small problem plug fraction wide fit 32gb 3gs. even squeeze insert pins, fit. cheap anything goes landfill. 
 case terrible!very flimsy, pretty, useless. glad paid next nothing one cases made unhappy. fan cases cover amount front phone. didn't cover much it, poor construction wouldn't allow case actually snap closed around phone. i'm sure broken shipping, production, time got end user product useless. 
 pretty phone caes however, paint started peeling within first two weeks owning it. basically get pay for. 
 purchased similar item. hoping would same. luck. wanted hold iphone car. strong enough. item purchased strong enough hold metal piece even case. one even strong enough hold phone own. returned soon got it. disappointed ordered wrong one!. 
 piece crap!!!!! magnet could barely hold pencil let alone heavy iphone 5. could rate product half star would touch much credit. purchase product. 
 t5 screwdriver work all. screw trying turn completely rounded, wasn't. bought much higher quality brand worked problem. screwdrivers complete junk don't waste money. plastic tool work okay, it's basically ruined one use. 
 product deficient quality, screwdrivers didn't last first screw heads got damaged, cheap product waste money well,dont buy it!!!!! 
 rather worthless, torx driver small fit anything &#34;most phone&#34;, tiny phillips driver that's totally useless &#34;most phone&#34; guitar pick (really!!) two plastic prybars might use, suction cup keyring attached. 
 add things buying phone. say thought would good case every needed get repairing phone major way. put order got email saying shipped 6 weeks later still tool also didn't receive another part group things ordered would recommend seller ever time. 
 would wiser spend little money get good sturdy stylus. don't recommend. 
 don't really hate all, sure great deal. haven't received yet. looking forward receiving 
 styli work matte anti glare screen protector. like protect electronics screen protector styli work screen protector. tried glossy screen protector. tips cheap touch worth amount bought nothing more. felt like thew three bucks toilet flushed down. favor get better stylus paying little more. guess greedy thought getting 3 great styli cheap buck half. 
 used one power sandisk sansa e280. failed within two days--less two hours use. sent back got another, failed within two days. piece junk. sansa doesn't even draw much power, old non-low-profile powered years. 
 bought pack travel bag use rental cars small is. must say nearly impossible remove. installed hertz rental, mazda 3 series think, nearly impossible get out. working car key angle turning, pulling, turning, pulling managed get 5 minutes work scraped knuckles. think probably great permanent install vehicle (though might care small then, course 2-port high power chargers almost small might want instead). travel bust. 
 recommend one buy product made china.now know cost $0.01, even though shipping cost $4.28.i used didn't even charge phone; instead drained phone's battery.worst all, device smells like burnt electrical wire. hot touch unplugged it.it quite possible left device plugged longer, would started fire.now, start looking another one, one won't burn one use.and, one actually charge phone battery.if shipping charges refundable, would return defective device. 
 purchased alernativewireles.com motorola droid 2 global. could barely get phone & out. wayyyy tight. second time extricated phone, stitches side ripped. poor quality fit droid 2 global stated description. 
 pretty cover seems decent quality price. like fact sort &#34;suede&#34; type feel outside won't drop easily. however, doesn't fit verizon iphone all- small. keep looking phone won't disappointed. toss one isn't worth bothering return it. 
 disappointed. item arrived one corners already broken (missing piece it, package). cover actually thick, it's slick seems picture. it's made cheap material makes iphone much larger without cover. fact believe falls down, cover click open protect phone all, what's point? look something else! 
 didn't like case sold fb try get money back sorry. 
 buy! wouldn't fit phone all. waste money since can't use it. 
 worked couple days, starting go out, noticed smell smoke. unplugged immediately threw trash. don't buy product, it's possible fire hazard. glad didnt plugged night asleep could caught fire! 
 don't think constructed actually charge 2 items once. 2 usb slots doesn't mean tolerate juice. gave soon purchase. 
 charger charge tablet something small, s4 galaxy tab 2 10". charge one other, chargers came devices...overall: small, older devices probably work you, otherwise pay money enough ampage. 
 thought great, didn't even use ports two days using...it didn't work anymore.seller: importer520 
 item failed first use. opened (i'm electrical engineer... open it, didn't i?) found decent circuit board, average components worst soldering job ever. failed? wires soldered back steel plug blades cold soldered came apart. plus blades held place friction fit also failed, leaving exposed metal socket plug came apart. construction bad estimate electrical integrity likely bad may actually harm delicate electronics like cell phones. careful avoid one!!!! 
 phone crashes constantly battery.when tried get replacement, seidio gave runaround refused issue rma. last two emails ignored. 
 cover battery came new listed, however inserted replacement battery tried put cover came it, immediately started problems. first all, battery cover wont properly latch phone time time actually come off. second thing noticed was, battery life palm pre plus ever slightly extended mean say, hardly noticeable.for extra bulk makes, self worth extra 30 minutes talk time gives. major problem problems listed that, replacement battery charges poorly say least. take forever charge use, use mobile hotspot feature palm pre plus, drains battery extremely fast. upon realizing this, started plugging phone home charger, however found even plugged in, battery still drains!i sense boxed big bulky worthless battery, bought car chargers switched back original battery cover. spend extra money better quality battery, wish had!!! 
 update: found method precentral determine actual battery capacity identified manufacturer. turns battery capacity 2300mah feeling ripped off. also another battery brand also showing mislabeled. complaining siedio posting back if/when make right.it still gives much better life standard battery, continue mislabel forced recommend brands available amazon anything siedio. explains barely getting twice life getting least 2.3x grrrr.i love pre+. one contacts calendar better palm. one ever has, one now, perhaps one ever will. but, pre uses battery centro battery life terrible. spent first day nothing internet appstore stuff, got 5 hours life stock battery. palm ashamed - get lot 5 hours notebook pc!so, 2.3 times capacity standard battery, get evening need recharge. don't use phone, able talk week one charge.this great choice want capacity. comes nicely finished back cover actually easier take put stock cover.two problems consider:1) doesn't work touchstone charger. didn't think would problem didn't even buy one. tried touchstone. coolest thing ever. sure wireless charging intelligent behavior changes touchstone nice. but, i'm impressed stick dashboard console equivalent car kit. much better slide around, look dial. i've ordered smaller seidio 1350mah battery fits standard cover 17% battery use touchstone i'm long drives. would give battery 5 stars option touchstone back plate. i'd willing pay $25-$30 it, too. hopefully technical reason can't make battery. don't care touchstone support, wont bother you.2) makes phone much thicker. problem me, actually makes easier type keyboard. but, goes "droid thin" 3/4" thick. that's thicker 1st-generation ipod 50% thicker blackberry curve. looking razor thin, need battery works stock cover. care long life, great.there batteries even bigger, twice price. hits right mix capacity size live thicker phone. two items don't bother you, great battery you, great price.oh, several mentioned problems loose fitting. apparently solved, fits well stock battery. ignore complaints. 
 dont usually get expensive accessories, decided splurge something nice new palm pre.unfortunately get pay for, tabs hold case onto phone broke month regular, well cared use, expensive case stay phone worthless. save money. 
 case many 5-star reviews. suspect reviews written soon user got case, put pre, impressed fit, finish, attractive minimalist design, matte finish, it's case still allows charge via touchstone. give one star b/c good case won't able use month?one main reasons bought case b/c high praise pre cen tral (seemed like everyone's standard case there) fact it's touchstone capable. sprint pre, know touchstone back included unlike verizon pre plus (edit 5/17/2010: pre plus avail at&t; include touchstone back charger! sprint continues fail selling original pre, pre plus, without accessories, yet it's still $150 many cities!). thought seidio's back replace palm's touchstone back received package discovered needed buy separate touchstone case (another $20). side note: accessories cost good change - $26 seidio case, $35 touchstone charger, another $20 touchstone back. spent $ 1 30 new pre radio shack 2 year contract. you're new pre, make sure use pre least month happy start plunking money expensive accessories.back topic: case way overpriced is. it's 2 pieces plastic (plus foam insert back cover you're using touchstone cover). depending buy, you'll spend anywhere $22-30+. plastic quite thin, however good thing b/c also feels quite strong, add significant bulk phone. that's one main differences compared $5 plastic cases ebay. plus it's feather light. fit perfect. thinness reason touchstone works. you're familiar touchstone, regular touchstone cover, magnetic field makes phone snap place quite firmly onto charger. putting thin piece plastic touchstone cover touchstone base. phone doesn't "snap" firmly onto charger less find sweetspot (you'll know feel it), charger, phone stays on. unfortunately, others mentioned, magnetic bond weak make stay place moving car.for wondering, case protrude gesture area impede gesture slider mechanism whatsoever. achieved? making tabs clip case onto phone small unobtrusive possible. major flaw. 4 tabs corner top cover bottom cover.i loved case. day 3, bottom-right tab snapped off. no, abuse phone case (it's new phone, remember?). regular use. understand, tabs small thin. give idea, tab width dental floss 3mm long. it's really matter time give break off. back cover 3 tabs became bit loose still usable. b/c pre legendary fit finish (ha!), loose back cover added slightly loose slider mechanism overall, phone felt cheap old. fast forward month today, bottom-left tab broke back cover pretty much useless. i've case little month.obviously, i'm one issue. find countless reviews tabs breaking. don't think unlucky ones. given time, case break. happen you. exception.so seidio addresses major design flaw, may better investing different case. touchstone important me, may want consider getting one zaggs clear films front - film advertised used "to protect helicopter blades" wrap around corners edges phone, flat top surface. back cover won't need protection b/c touchstone cover rubbery, scratchproof finish replaceable.i've read one reviewer saying seidio replaced case free contacting seidio soon see get free replacement well. even that, want keep repeating pattern ship broken case get new one?update 5/17/2010: actually contacted seller (authorized dealer) case replaced promptly free. ship them, cost two stamps envelope. time, got enjoy month, unfortunately, one tabs broke. i'm done case. i'll look getting clear film top using touchstone back.with everything said, cannot recommend case. save money look alternatives.update 7/20/2010: agf makes case that's touchstone compatible. google "agf grt pre case". said, enjoying case pre also means don't put bulk headache breaking. beginning thought needed case instinctively protect new investment. anything, enough use, amount care attachment dwindles time. screen protector film front touchstone back. bought screen protector film e bay (5 $3 shipped) it's zaggs cover entire front surface (does go curved corner areas), it's good enough me. zaggs overpriced anyway. 
 tabs break way easy! broke 2 within 2-3 weeks use! like little bulk added compared cases ended dropping phone 2-3x due stupid tabs breaking felt safer taking case off. would pick phone & case would pop would holding case & phone ground. also drop case case pop off! @ least body glove case didn't pop dropped (the whole reason buy case) drop phone lot!update 12/18/09got replacement, went ok within 2 weeks (possibly less) 1 tab broken & hill there, 2 days latter another broken & 3rd way out. took off. less stress & less likely drop without case. (i woudl find self holding case hand phone floor due case breaking)try body glove one don't care ts charger! little sturdy, handle drop 5. 
 speck case broke easily. rubber connects hard plastic separated every case owned. also, thin piece plastic bottom case breaks half use. would recommend product 
 wow, wish i'd read reviews actually purchasing product.design = horrible. people claim "protects" something beyond me. certainly doesn'tthe "skin" (that's is) isn't 'shell', it's piece plastic easily broken covers back phone.while didn't issue 3rd party connectors (ie: radio additions), see could problemwhile didn't huge problem vibrate switch, again, see problem future. hands huge, going nightmare eventually.the worst part? protection offered face all. protectors least wrap around front, offering minimal sort 'padding'. thing? nope, sits right around back, even touching front part phone. bad, front part phone one that's fragile!! 
 bought sim card put mother's law snaphone sending michigan, needed passcode establish account line, refill sim card, well silly thing, seemed like rocket science people, impossible .my husband spent hour th e phone, explaining robot, whole situation, mr. robot kept repeating lines, matter, said, kept repeating thing, nothing asking for. customer service, zero, need, happens robots repeat, luck, not.throw sim card trash.what else.i thought att good service back old mobile. 
 overall, worth getting, even 8 bucks.pros:the earbuds stay good sealgood sound calls audiobooks, acceptable musiccons:microphone goodthe control microphone nothing, media player, phone calls, anythingit huge microphone portion attached. essentially earbuds one piece, put another hunk wiring microphone. microphone nowhere near face figure clamp it's remotely near mouth.would buy again. doubts lg product despite label it. 
 it's bad used battery even though listed new one. crack one corner. charged whole day, put phone still juice. waste $5............. 
 battery wouldn't hold charge faulty beginning. disappointed would recommend anyone. total waste money! 
 tried two tours couldn't take anymore. got 8830 actually works. here's analogy...would rather mercedes (bberry tour) that's shop, toyota (8830) drive? list complaints comments tour:1) trackball didn't work correctly first one. tours, realized would accidentally hit trackball left thumb would go right side keyboard. (for typing word "you" problem.) "bump" would make cursor jump typing mess sentence. 8830 trackball farther away don't cursor jumping issue. thumbs stay side keyboard, it's likely problem you.2) sound horrible. remember old tv shows people disguised voices talking handkerchief? rim brought technology tour! everyone complained couldn't hear me...like muffled. (i test heard too.) handset! speakerphone worse quiet muffled. bluetooth unusuable. really i'd say tour great device, don't need use phone!3) battery life horrible. 2 hours talk time maybe 5 standby dead. used talk 8 hours previous bberry could go days standby. happened?4) gps worked great first one couldn't lock location 10 minutes second one. made realize didn't work second one correctly. unfortuately verizon disables gps 8830 didn't win point. love gps google maps tour.5) media player fine. crashed watching certain mp4 movies watched don't know cause.6) camera video camcording great actually...at least cell phone great.my advice get tour, make sure don't trackball problem, make sure give phone someone else call know pain others feel talking you. me, unbearable people say "what?" 5 times per conversation. own... 
 didnt' work two blackberry phones would sync either blackberry phones.------- ended getting visor mount motorolla works great. 
 horrible customer service - contacted directly dissatisfied product, he(she) resorted personal, verbal assaults instead dealing issues - wow - unbelievable. don't waste time - charge 50% restocking fee returns! review update: seller altec. would like stress comments directed towards seller, product - headphones fine, complaints there. 
 got belt clip otterbox defender case iphone 3gs. belt clip hold phone securely, belt clip extremely prone dropping phone.in six eight months i've otter case / belt clip, i've dropped phone due clumsiness once, phone hit deck lousy belt clip dropped maybe 99 times, including toilet! defender case amazingly effective, iphone lives unscathed, nary scratch, (oh irony) otterbox belt clip far single greatest threat iphone faces. belt clip warrants stars, zero, zip, nada, nil.the design belt clip simply failure. first all, unless everything absolutely perfect, defender case "snap in" belt clip. part (sides bottom) otter defender silicone cover perfectly fit onto case properly closed up, small bit clothing fabric gets mix, phone "lock" goes belt clip. since "feedback" whether it's "locked in" way find it's locked phone falls ground floor (or water). even snap in, it's strong hold, significant jolt bump movement halfway decent excuse worthless belt clip drop $5-6-7-800 worth iphone careening onto concrete. finally, clamp actually clips holder onto pants "locked open" setting. idea positive purpose design intended for, practice, tends lock open want open bending moving forth, again, whole thing likely drop waist (again) hit ground.i strongly recommend otter defender case, think people know belt clip comes works exact opposite direction protection. i've belt clip, it's junk. i'm throwing away going look one actually holds phone. 
 three clips break buy case; blet clips me.i abuse clips unless call normal wear teacher abuse. 
 waste money. followed instructions yet constantly air bubbles. i've repeated process without success. recommend. 
 exact charger came earpiece, one received amazon match one came samsung earpiece. color grayish ... cable material different ... cable length different ... micro usb plug different ... everything slightly ...so ... close copy genuine samsung product ... going risk using phone damage phone :(at least less $5 ... 
 ordered charger palm pre. lasted 5 months cable started tear end, connection goes cell phone. bit, wires sticking failed charge phone. piece junk - wouldn't buy again! buy name brand stuff. one got phone lasted longer rip one did! 
 would like hand advertising people. make sound like wireless charging device reality buy special case select devices ... buy way sold separately. situations don't offer special case wireless power cord adapter available purchase negates whole wireless idea, sold separately. many detail reviews saying thing isn't sleek sounds many hidden costs. must add adapter phone (which make bigger) order charge it.what would like mention alternative. check following link gomadic's universal charging station, charging station true charging station comes charger free tips charge many devices. see sell tips separately 3,000+ devices, charging station truly upgradable universal hidden gotchas.gomadic universal charging station apple iphone 3gs many mobile devices - uses gomadic tipexchange technology - 4 tips included 
 engineer, seems obvious product could function simply marketed. marketing completely misleading.standard devices like carry inductive charger built in, way powermat induce charging current device would delivered battery without sort wired connection.i surprised, sympathetic still surprised, many people would believe magic works simply marketed - "just toss iphone pad charges!" guess passengers maglev trains europe never charge devices.it gives perspective level understanding people electronic world live in. 
 four charging doors bought none work directed. yet able charge phone. 
 review changed due change product description.this originally advertised wireless charging product wired charging capability. controversy wireless aspect led device title name impossible knock deceptive. powermat.if type person go way cut cable clutter costs, including loss simultaneous usability charging, perhaps may work needs.cable/clutter phobic: personality aspect exist. although cables still provide fastest delivery data, charge functionality wireless alternatives date people go way avoid visible cable.wireless option, yes. easier usb plug, no. cutting clutter, don't consider mat wireless charging case clutter. personally, picking cable already sitting night stand, desk, console easy gets.as multifunctional charging base, make sure investigate fully comes box additional potential purchase requirements devices supported without optional accessories. 
 doesn't remotely anything says -- picture misleading, title misleading, concept misleading. purchase additional receivers attach phone, charge. basically sorta-cool looking way-too-big multi functioning charger wireless showerhead. read packaging still figure -- open up, course. 
 found hard see iphone navigation mode hard remove phone answer it. i'm longer using mount. car blue tooth latter less issue. phone won't go mount bumper it. 
 item that's pictured here! totally different item! returned soon opened packaging! amazon host third party items advertised correctly! 
 worst screen protectors ever purchased. always applying new ones every three months problems bubbles one two get out, terrible. went three trying get one without thousands bubbles underneath thicker usual protectors. buy again. went wal-mart bought them. paid money, bubbles. item appears seller described work supposed to. thanks thanks! :( 
 gotten part either house went p.o. post office said hasnt gone past forwarding please fix it! looooong time. already also 
 need talented get on. thin bubble easily. unless surgen,you tear first one.....that's come 3 pack. 
 waiting mophie release iphone 5 case got sick (5 months? seriously?) read surfacepad online, ordered it, love it! looks great, fits phone perfectly, really allows design i5 speak itself. could pleased!edit 6/22/2013: take thing phone, "seam" leather (which actually glued) started split come away cardboard (!) inside. twelvesouth supposedly warranty, contacted replacement. claimed record email address. verified email used sending copy invoice, never heard again. twelvesouth company want business with- make quality products stand behind them. avoid. 
 worst case ever. nice design whomever manufactured it, used lowest quality materials. less months use falling apart. looks like service 5 years. spend money elsewhere. find without original box cannot return refund, deal vendor best, get replacement. so, i'm stuck 
 leather construction design case certainly novel, however major design flaw.the iphone 5 noise canceling microphone back near camera lens. fold cover surfacepad back talk phone hold phone ear cover blocks microphone. result callers trouble hearing sound garbled choppy. first thought caused location. multiple calls various locations one could hear well. removing phone surfacepad calls locations problems callers could hear loud clear. conclusion problem surfacepad, case cover folds talk going cause problem.if use case using device things talking use wired bluetooth headset ok case, kinda defeats purpose phone ( talking ).it also kinda awkward feeling looks pretty strange holding ear front cover folded back.i ended buying 2 ( 1 red - 1 white ) hex solo wallet iphone 5 cool case holds id credit card cover block microphone. works marvelous.so want use phone like phone avoid surfacepad ! 
 cover floppy since doesnt bend side phone stand stand. plus get one piece grit scratch screen. 
 cover protects back. face phone completely exposed. what's use? 
 mean, 2009 expect even cheap bluetooth headphones ok. awful.my unit almost certainly defective seems wires crossed callers heard instead me.but even callers able hear (a luxury, know) shoddy build quality really awful design (they're huge) would warrant one-star review.while sound quality calls passable, unit doesn't appear utilize edr means awful mp3 sound quality.anyway, users commented, keep looking, get much better headsets price. 
 you're looking average, every day bluetooth stereo headset, might okay you, it's definitely you're music lover. sound quality pair received really pretty poor. don't even look quality bass sound - it's there.i found that, positioned exactly ears, sound coming headset, reason, seemed getting filtered far away. wasn't matter volume - sound quality tenqa pair got seems really substandard. bass sound seems strain these, causing annoying crackling sound accompanying music that's playing.having asked callers sound calls, i've told sound "hollow", i'm "in chamber", found sound end calls, well.as far headset's appearance goes, looks like it's average quality, quite lightweight - may consider good thing, like know products i'm buying decent weight them, seem strongly made. wouldn't say either conditions met headset.overall, place value headset quality appear be, wouldn't price higher ten note. don't stand headsets current price range. you're willing drop thirty bluetooth stereo headset, keep looking - aren't worth it, opinion. 
 recently switched iphone 4s - solid, square cut metal edges, bit chunky - iphone 5c, thin, smooth plastic model. it's actually comfortable hand 4s 5s, need little protection: maybe something little less slippery. first tried acimo shell holster, awful: foam case soft, hard remove phone holster. decided go minimal, got simple clear plastic snap-on case belkin.it's simple, basic, unobtrusive, fancy. it's almost exactly right, except one thing. it's *just* bit long. one two millimeters. result phone jiggles case. down, side side. lot. enough set-your-teeth-on-edge annoying.maybe it's me. perhaps i'm fussy. pull phone (in case) leather holster belt, press power button top, don't want phone shift case. does. every time.sigh.update: i've traveling hong kong last week, using iphone extensively mapping, twitter, checking conference schedules, forth. jiggling phone case driving crazy. originally gave two stars, tried living it. one star - that's generous! 
 pro's:bright blue colorsleek-doesn't add bulk 5ccon's:flimsy plasticdoesn't protect frontlooks cheapvery slippery could make lose grip drop phonesave $10.00 look something better 
 went opening package trash within 24 hours.. looking throw away case weekend trip case you. 
 looking purchase, shouldn't expected much. $7.00 shipped? stupid expect something high quality.1) case best part. it's hard plastic rubberized. belt-clip feature well, nice. protect phone scratches. said, it's black rubberized white plastic, first time drop scuff it, white spot. biggest deal.2) screen cover falls almost immediately. really low quality. even on, really made screen look fuzzy, fell off, felt remorse.3) worst part charger. nothing rapid charger. doesn't charge phone. again, hold it, realize light is, shouldn't expect great results. weight 1/10th much i-go car, charges 1/10th much charger should. plug phone 1 bar battery programs running, 1 bar battery hour later unplug it. use programs make call, phone lose battery even plugged in. 
 car charger fit curve 8530 neither face cover. buyer beware 
 lcd protector fit phone start. caused blister edges turn caused dust buildup eventually push protector away lcd protecting. plastic case comes devise made poor materials clips hold together broke putting together. basically paid money use items 1 day. worth money, shipping longer worked phone. 
 item broken received it, edge broken opened soft pack came in. 
 benefit see one limited number electrical outlets. need devices charged one outlet area measuring 9"x8"?as nice idea "wireless charging" may sound, it's not, honest probably much hassle plugging device outlet it's charger (usually supplied purchased)the mat looks nice, it's thin stylish, uses one electrical outlet course, would grace counter-top area keep keys phone charge them.while wondering for, also asked actually charges phones household anyway?you need attach "power clip" know, like would attach power cord usually use charge phone. hopefully one 3 included adapter tips actually work model phones mini usb port.i 3 month old lg shine, guess they're really obscure? (you guessed it) adapter doesn't work phone, displays "mp3 charge error" attached.the box boasts support nokia, motorola blackberry doubt works ok them, mine requires another "tip" - sold separately course.the box also says charge 4 devices once! wow! - one clip? checked sure enough buy additional clips, they're $35 piece!so sum up, little $200 charge four devices shiny silver pad wireless technology ??? stick original chargers cost mmmm, oh yeah free! gimme break. isn't waste money don't know is. 
 first excited duracel mygrid starter kit. wife impatient tangled cables running everywhere, thought would great set charging station counter one cable. opened package set up, realized isn't workable solution family.___________________what get:* good sized platform set four devices charging.* charger cable.* three types charger tips.* one adhesive clip (yes, one)___________________the problems:starting obvious: kit comes one adhesive clips required charge device. whole kit gets one charged phone. that's shame, since two charging tips included package.speaking package, packaging worse most. charging tips nearly impossible get package without damaging them. wouldn't tried hard i'd know could use one them.most importantly, charging solution designed leave tip fairly bulky adhesive clip attached phone times. means you'll much bulkier phone pocket, probably won't fit holster case anymore. tip clip also interfere buttons near charging port phone.you also trouble access charging port phone data transfer, likely, since two three included tips mini-usb. means you'll remove tip beneath clip connect data cable (and hope don't lose tip).i found setup impractical create nuisance charging cables. entire purpose product reduce number cables, solution worse problem. wife one hates charger cables, told get rid charging station asap.even could get nuisance bulk added phone, price seems way high get rid couple cables. remember you'll need purchase additional tips & clips charge one phone. 
 product, never heard charging mat/grid, first experience one. first question seeing item was: why? would someone need charge items together one place? three different cell phones charge different brands? concept neat, wonder many people would really see benefit type item? example, iphone (and stupid me, didn't realize item, box, didn't iphone clip) case, i'd spending $76 (!!!) get charging grid another $35 get iphone sleeve (which tell isn't yet). so, spend $110 charge iphone duracell mygrid, or, charge free cable came included iphone. &lt;sarcasm> tough choice &lt;/sarcasm>i don't see item for. families perhaps? can't imagine person owns one phone would ever use device. you'd family four lost charging cables find benefit using device. simply cost savings (cost increase, actually) you'll likely incur even cost phone isn't supported box (the mygrid supports blackberries, lgs nokias).so took thing work see anyone would use it. remember, mat supports lg, nokia blackberry box. however, one willing adhere anything phone and/or phone wouldn't fit adapters (we iphones, lot blackberry storms winmo devices). simply put, one interest using thing!i finally got boyfriend use item, though wasn't enthused something stuck back phone didn't adhere permanently. finally unpacked thing, noticed 1 clip included. nice. guess much another clip is? $35! charging four phones thing, you're looking total cost $181!we finally put device mygrid yes, charged. charged well. device sleek looking lightweight. that's positive thing say it. setup installation super easy.basically, device isn't convenient. it's expensive likely require purchase clips sleeves. that's one expensive way charge phone!pros:* attractive design* ease use* convenience, sort-ofcons:* cost! omg, cost! $76 wayyyy much money thing. even five cell phone brands supported box came five clips, $76 would still way much item.* box, get one clip. additional clips $35* iphones supposed supported, sale yet. and, again, another $35 want charge iphone.* i'm sticking anything phone, period. there's way i'm walking around something adhered back it, adding bulk. 
 duracell mygrid awesome idea went wrong somewhere r&d; labs packaging marketing departments. idea conductive mat charge multiple phones something cool could used many households. duracell's implementation idea utterly fails couple reasons, though.first, what's box underwhelming. get mat, ac plug, one swivel clip, 3 adapters. 3 adapters 2 mini-usb adapters (one right side up, upside down) 1 nokia adapter. clearly, mgrid development years released now. evident mini-usb plugs typically found phones 2008 older, nokia plug, useful world-wide, doesn't high penetration rate us. least, high rate among type early adopters would interested product. iphone adapter (until spring 2010?), palm adapters, unbelievably, micro-usb adapters (commonly found 2009 newer phones). you're still rockin' razr 2006, maybe you'll find what's box useful. purchase product, given me, actually bust old razr test it...second, conductive clip part adhesive back supposed stick back phone, one 3 included adapters jammed side bottom phone. yeah, adhesive, in--it's gonna forever. adding bulk phone. joke. top that, smartphone want sync computer 2008 mini-usb port, um, well, can't cuz adapter jammed plug. even slip adapter, clip back still going block many usb connector cables there. finally, you're using mini-usb phone 2008, you're probably going get new one 2010 (when 2yr contract expires), means somehow peel adhesive place new phone (assuming buy new adapter duracell's website future fits new phone). able position clip adapter razr without using adhesive, magnet surprisingly strong. pulling phone mat caused lot strain phone's usb port. repetitive usage like could easily damage port phone. addition, without adhesive, took way longer insert clip + adapter razr carefully pull mat finished simply plug/unplug regular ac charger, thereby eliminating advantages using mat.i mention grid indeed work charge razr time regular ac charger. duracell totally failed execution device. people make batteries! need duracell-made battery replacements small metal conductance nubs back. way pop new battery lay phone, without extra bulk, directly grid. palm pre phone touchstone accessory works incredibly well. also, duracell offer replacement batteries/adapters cameras, video game controllers, electronic devices. would 5-star, highly versatile product this. no, instead get 2 mini-usb plugs, nokia plug, one swivel clip. craptastic failure pile box!as techie gadget lover, want really like product. actual grid cool. unfortunately, word adequately describe adapters + clip idea "stupid." time writing this, grid goes $70-90. dropped price $50, included adapters video game controllers cameras, offered conductive replacement batteries website like mentioned above, thing would gadget-person's dream charging station. then, i'm sure people duracell pushed market. bad... 
 duracell powergrid trying desperately capitalize new cordless charging device playground, service item provides date borders embarrassing. basically, device's cordless charging capabilities based sort remote plug put wireless phone mp3 player lay pad. three chargers come device devices old would need travel back time least three years find device could put chargers in. forget ipod newer blackberry newer wireless device, period. want charge powergrid, guess do?you buy chargers.there way part device simplify life even make happy way, skip it. 
 product case creating poor solution problem doesn't really exist. really easy charge phone plugging charger came it. wait, instead want glue weird disc back phone, add special tips charge it? buy special sleeve adds bulk cost same? thanks. 
 got charging station thinking would save us octopus tangle wires desk alas found frustrating. idea behind station simple - one plug, multiple phones charged duracell mention phone want charge must special clip. clip supposed permanently attached phone, thus making difficult keep protective cover case.the kit easy use comes one clips (this kit comes 3 - one blackberry, one set motorola last use nokia). want charge second phone need additional clips, purchase separately, making set cost effective.while great idea paper certainly well executed. someone creates power charging grid one simply place phone attachments stick charging cord. 
 one poorest designed products seen. price way range. comes one bulky "thumb charger clip" (and three adapters may may fit phone) attaches cell phone tape(provided). adapters expensive, around $30. adapters fit phones models. wanted buy 4 adapters would cost $120. charging grid cost $70 4 adapters $130, total price charge 4 phones around $200.i motorola phone work with, tape "thumb clip" found bulky carry pocket. since switched samsung phone adapters fit samsung.i use product cluttering closet waiting discarded. product poorly designed priced high duracell would choose market it. product much trouble deal with...and rarely write one star review. buy product. look grids wait improvement design price go down.i bet amazon retailers flooded returns. shame duracell trying push good idea, poorly designed product! 
 duracell mygrid charging device product want like. imagine possibilities, come home toss phone, ipod device pad walk away. wires plug unplug, several chargers plugged wall outlet. wireless home power grid, truly wave future.in reality, though, truly product far ready prime time "wave future" powergrid would think is. accurately "extension cord" transfers power via contacts totally traditional way.it ships 3 tips fit infinitesimally small number phone models. unfortunately, blackberry cell phone. design power tips prevent used device exact model specified.there two glaring problems duracell considered abandoned whole concept power grid. one location charging receptacle varies phone phone. mine impossible fit connect included charging adapter.the problem charging adapter itself. fairly large disc glue back phone double-stick tape. whaaat? kidding me? make line little charging tip probably 90% likely glued phone's camera, flash rear speaker. that's plain dumb!not mention, cell phone bought small convenient possible, slip pocket purse nice leather carrying case ... more! fragile adapter sticking side bottom phone, plus clunky odd-shaped stick-on disc, phone longer fits easily pocket, purse case handled extreme care extra pieces don't break get lost. plus, many phones use mini-usb connector, connector may used headphones, car speaker accessories data access. remove power tip time. convenient simply plugging phone charging cord?you also get optional overpriced "powersleeve" miniscule devices rubber boot fits device awkward hump back bottom device. maybe slightly better concept glue-on disc far seen one model ipod one model blackberry.another major failing products travel lot probably take charging adapter you. certainly won't take power grid. means removing power tip time reassembling use grid home. would get old first time.i fail see slightest advantage entire product; it's like bad april fools joke. someday someone come way transfer electric power without wires; understand technology already exists. duracell someone else comes power grid doesn't need ill-conceived adapters i'll interested.as far "instruction manual" goes, almost non-existent. product like people never used before, severely lacking.sorry duracell, can't give one star "interesting idea". 
 see reason item. first must attach small device phone. leave phone, every time charge must attach it. charge using device. leave attached, sticks can't use protective case phone. also, comes devices phones fit phone. need spend money get connector phone.forget item. actually difficult charge phone. 
 excited get item thought would quick easy convenient wrong. charging tips fit phone motorola nokia. lg big motorola, duracell doesn't even make adapter far could find out. charging pad smaller thought, smaller mouse pad. another dumb design put clip stick back phone, like need bulk it. don't want adhere clip spend another 35 bucks rubber sleeve put phone, already one protection don't need another.the whole thing works magnets clip, tip charging mat metal looks like scratch fast. i've seen connectors iphone, xbox 360 controllers well wii ps3 parts another investment 40 bucks. unless blackberry, nokia motorola phone one mini usb style ports, don"t get this! duracell needs go back drawing board redesign charging tips included starter kits lg samsung iphone included!!!pros:*only works motorola nokia boxcons:*doesn't work lg phones (tips made it)*iphones need additional attachment costing 35 bucks*small charging mat size*other limited brand adapters cost 35-40 dollars*have adhere clip back phone 
 feel sad guilty ordering item causing environmental waste. let explain.the box contained one charging surface, one power clip, 3 tips. 2 tips mini-usb sockets another seemed intended nokia device. cell phones motorola, none tips suitable phones.charging suface: looks cool, complaints.power clip: thin, flat, tear drop shaped piece plastic. need one things every device want charge. supply one. supposed stick (built-in pre-glued surface exists) back device. place device holster, sleeve, enclosure, forget it. surface flat clip contacts touch charging suface facilitating charging device.tips: one end tip goes device end contacts power clip. tip projects device - causing problems inserting device holster.why totally useless me:1) doesn't work phones - tips don't match use holsters phones.2) things charge using device gps mp3 player. don't charge home even week.for purposes, following product works much better:leviton l02-49686-00w 6 outlet adapter grounded white 
 product meant mistaken inductive charging system 3 major problems:1. box says charges 4 devices-- well, two iphones would barely fit it... you'll charging 4 those. power supply comes 1a power supply, iphone needs less amp charge full speed... can't charge 2 iphones full speed.2. product requires customer use special case... make sure said case ill-fitting unattractive.3. case must removed sync, charge normal charger.if willing accept limitations, win ease plugging iphone get home... really hard do? 
 i, like many cellphone users, really excited product announced. induction charging wave future charging small portable devices... unfortunately duracell's mygrid stuck flood past; still using connectivity charge devices - albeit clunky, ugly, inconvenient way.for reason head unit would utilize tiny little dongle would contain components needed charge phone. but, i'm sure you've seen, dongle connects bulky round disc houses charging system. disc charging prongs mated base mat form circuit charging. rather look around cellphone charger look around bulky disc, really convenient. course could tape disc phone, increasing phone's girth weight rendering cellphone belt useless... that's really convenient it?frankly don't see situation anyone benefits device. poorly thought aging tech. avoid. 




 works nokia 5530. inexpensive, got 2, one car emergencies. original nokia chargers retail box. brand knock (yes, everything made china days - real mccoy)...... 
 wife three years still working. great phone! 
 love device - it's one allows plug headset. happy report works perfectly verizon xv6800 smartphone (also known htc 6800 mogul 6800 sprint). one reviewing tried device, wanted functionality took chance ordered anyway. works perfectly!

 bought primarily headphones rather hands free aspect, relates headphones. sound much better anticipated, would recommend anyone compatable lg phone.i used hands free couple times works reasonably well, pick enough outside wind noise make practical moderately windy days.

 little $2, find faults charger. bought two iphones, used dozen long trips, still work perfectly fine. 
 travel charger iphone fits iphone 4 fine, charges fine, it's sturdy. see know problems item. 
 worried bad reviews, however said re-desighned took chance, first one received large crack it, packaged ended returning ordering again, next one came box good. pleased this, ordered one price style different brand two like one better.- thin slim style ad bulk it- brand same-the belt clip much stronger looking brand, say need super strong clip may you, stronger brand ordered-one feature one clip one side case stand one don't want holster part use stand want pushed don't to, brand built holster clip scince phone faces seems kinda useless me. strong is?? problem would carefull. also otter box, say like one much better don't need super strong thick bulky type case, like switch cases colors suit mood, need. kind use love take gym clip shirt pants whatever problam want use stand playing works good, make higher end looking one got, like prefer one, said need super strong case may protection purse car basic use case good. buy again. 
 may everyone, like it. case solid. screen well protected leaving ample openings on/off, volume, camera, speaker, pen, earphone, microusb port. heeding warning users beltclip breaks readily, intentionally broke :) put rest holder/phone cargo pants. real fast getting phone out, bluetooth ubiquitous days, there's less need speed. built-in stand little unstable 'portrait' position, works fine 'landscape' position. also works well dash (gps) holder: i.trek me-usdm universal dashboard mount, also amazon. 
 i've found far best method clipping phone belt, i've used others many expensive always come back one built kickstand ability easily quickly slide phone out.they're cheap yes i've never problems durability except long time use, much longer would expect cheap piece plastic last, ones kickstands like locking mechanism eventually wears whole thing easily replaceable.i times knocked phone holster bumping something tradeoff pay lock obstructing access device. 
 pay verizon store. verizon store can't get belt clip samsung galaxy note 2. 
 well build carrying case last while.it eye catcher design allows phone breath get heated like cases.the belt clip build well,very solid also turns 360 degree positioned direction.this exact fit note 2 worth time. 
 going purchase phone, knew would need holster use practically. previous phone, droid 3, also holster, liked much. never grew fond idea putting phone pocket.i bought holster 4/26/13 and, despite many negative reviews, pretty sure bought new improved design. i've holster little 2 months time writing it's holding well. kickstand strong, feel weak flimsy, placing gn2 inside case, snaps firmly. in, would need like plastic pry tool get again, placing gn2 holster, fits fine.so far, dis-colorization (i white edition match housing gn2), criss-cross pattern isn't fading away, belt clip strong sturdy. use belt clip everyday hints anything telling it's going break time soon. belt clip place, stays there.as stated throughout review, don't see abnormalities product. managed break myself, would buy replacement. 
 fit function great. kickstand big plus. form tight cut outs neat.

 real strong rugged case awesome would recommend anyone alot outside work real strong 
 bought artic red frost nexus 4. love material case makes strong hold phone (hard rubber-type material) case also covers parts bezel-- enough damage screen laid screen. cut-outs aligned perfectly. two cons hard press power button & doesn't good grip. although ease press volume buttons, apply pressure power button. maybe mistake creating. week, kind got used it, bother much always notice it. somewhat slippery back, sorta makes hold slippery. speaking back, back makes phone looks awesome. transparent clearly read 'nexus' & 'lg' back. gives phone good look. grip, severe issue, level grip less case greatshield. want put consumers consider. another thing i'll add looks pretty cool sunlight. see part actual phone case sunlight makes mostly edges case glisten. conclude, sticking case look, protection, decent grip. 
 it's slip case looks good protects phone light drops onto desk. thick enough keep lens glass display glass touching laying phone down. also love diamond patterned grips sides phone - makes grabbing run real easy, slipping. money, it's good buy you're looking keep phone pocket without adding lot bulk. 
 excellent tpu case. looks great, slim, improves grip, protects phone drops concrete. say? 
 purchased case girlfriend new samsung galaxy s4. using otterbox commuter dissatisfied case's bulk. i'm big fan tpu cases, got one couldn't happier it. fits snugly, looks great, covers buttons (big plus), isn't bulky. case bulky, still offers protection camera lens screen tiny ridges surrounding parts keep coming contact surface rest phone resting on. fact case inexpensive adds otherwise perfect rating. 
 mix smooth ridged surfaces nice touch aesthetically also helps keep nice grip smooth bit slippery. case fits like glove holes cuts outs fit various ports perfectly. price item hard beat arrived quickly. haven't tried fun nfc features yet, i'm anticipating problems.all all, you're looking nice, simple bumper case suggest look (assuming price still good). 
 fits like glove. adds bulk phone - gs4 stays slim light!the kickstand works, doesn't slide around, nice firm. clicks shut two tiny tabs plastic either end kickstand, guess time tabs break won't stay shut anymore. moment, tabs really tiny hopefully break anytime soon.the downsides find are:a. hard feel whether pressed power/volume button not, there's tactile feedback push. work though.b. screw(?) holds kickstand place back case bulges makes phone sit slightly lopsided put flat surface facing upward. issue me, didn't expect screw bulge way does.otherwise satisfied. 
 simple looks great!! job, fits well, good grip. love would definitely recommend. 
 love case! doesn't look cheap, arrived time, place inside change purse wallet silver snap closure. protects phone's edges. recommend case. 
 great cover fit perfect looks really good price fair. company also sent 2 screen protectors free perfect well.
